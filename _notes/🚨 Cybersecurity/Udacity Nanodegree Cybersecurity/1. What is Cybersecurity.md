Cybersecurity is and FBI Priority
> *Protect the United States against cyber-based attacks and high-technology crimes*

### Cybersecurity definition
- According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST):
	- **Prevention** of damage to, **protection** of, and restoration of computers, electronic communications systems, electronic communications services, wire communication, and electronic communication, including information contained therein, to ensure its availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and nonrepudiation.
	- Prevention, protection and restoration
	- Electronic devices and information contained therein
	- Availability, Integrity, Authentication, Confidentiality, and nonrepudiation.

## Security Business

US Federal Communications Commission (FCC):
- Internet allows businesses of all sizes, types, industires and from any location.
- Cybersecurity should be part of the plan of any of this business.
	- Protect their technologies, data, and people from cyber attacks.

6. 2001 - Advanced Encryption Standard ( #AES ) established by NIST

# Cybersecurity Environments, tools ,and websites

Windows’ built-in security tools
- Control Panel
- Computer management
- Local security policies
Other tools to use as a cybersecurity professional
- Sysinternals Suite
- Windows God Mode
- Autoruns
- NMap - network manager
- 7-zip

# Cybersecurity Overview

- Computer are everywhere → Internet of Things
	- IoT → Anything that is connected to a network
		- Cloud → Enable systems, apps, and data to be reached from anywhere using almost any device.
- Apps and websites contain sensitive data → Targets for threats

Growth of the Cybersecurity Market
- By 2024 → Expected to grow to $300-billion
	- Hardware, software, Security operations center
	- From 120 billion to 300 billion by 2024

### Cybersecurity Market size to value $900 Bn by 2032

## The security Mindset
> *“The security mindset involves thinking about how things can be made to fail”*
> - Bruce Shneider

Look for vulnerabilities and error messages to better understand how the technology works.

Figurate how security can be bypassed to better understand how it can be strengthened

1. Trust, but verify
2. Stop. Think. Connect
3. If you see something, say something.
	1. Report issues or errors to indicate persons and proprietaries

- A good security mindset is about being curious about how things work and why they work the way they do.

## Security Trends

https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/

From the 2020 Verizon Data Breach [Investigations Report](https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/executivebriefs/2020-dbir-executive-brief.pdf):

1. 70% of attacks were perpetrated by outsiders and 34% involved internal actors.
2. 45% of breaches featured Hacking, 22% included social attacks, and 17% involved malware. 86% of the breaches were financially motivated
3. 72% of victims were large businesses and 28% were small businesses.

Even though these values change over time, the general concepts have remained steady. Take time to understand this report as it's used throughout the cybersecurity industry.
### How
- **Phishing** 🐟 [[Phishing]]: *A technique for attempting to acquire sensitive data through a fraudulent solicitation in email or website in which the perpetrator masquerades as a legitimate business or reputable person.*
	- Spear Phishing:
		- Attackers customize their messages for specific individuals or organizations
		- Emails may content personalized information → More convincing
	- Whaling:
		- Targets high-profile individuals within an organization
			- Executives, top-level managers, or individuals with access to sensitive information
	- SMS-hing (smishing)
	- Vishing (Voice mail) → Artificial intelligence
	- Instant Message (Chat) → Zoom, meets, whatsApp
- **Ransomware** 😎:
	- Malware: Malicious software
		- sorfware or firmware intended to perform an unauthorized process that will have an adverse impact on the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an information system
			- A virus, trojan, worm, or other code-based entity
	- Block access to computer system
	- Often accept Bitcoin as payment
- **Business Email compromise** 📧 → #BEC
	- The victim thinks it is a legitimate business transaction
	- Access to a business email account
	- Imitates the owner’s identity
	- Defraud the company and its employees, customers or partners
### No. 1 way for scams
-  **Social engineering** and Scams 🫂
	- And attempt to trick someone into revealing information that can be used to attack systems or networks
### New ways to attack
- Smart devices
- Internet of Things
- Cloud services
