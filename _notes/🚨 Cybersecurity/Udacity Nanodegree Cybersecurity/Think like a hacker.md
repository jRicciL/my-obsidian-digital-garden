# Hacking Lifecycle

Real hackers use a specific lifecypcle

1. Goal-Target:
    1. Understand what you are assessing it’s security
2. Learn it:
    1. Learn as much as you can about it.
3. Explore it → Reconocense
    1. Understand how it works and what other know about it. This is knon as reconnaissance.
4. Break it → only with permission
    1. Understand the target’s weaknesses or vulnerabilities
    2. You need a "*get out of jail free*" card from the asset owner to stay out of trouble if something should go wrong when you're testing
5. Fix it (if you break something):
    1. Secure operating systems, applications and networks
6. Make it better → Figure a better way to secure the system
7. Tell others → About the things you learn and discovered
	1. This is ==ethical disclosure==
