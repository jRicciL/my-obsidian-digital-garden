# Introduction

Cybersecurity is and FBI Priority
> *Protect the United States against cyber-based attacks and high-technology crimes*

### Cybersecurity definition
- According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST):
	- **Prevention** of damage to, **protection** of, and restoration of computers, electronic communications systems, electronic communications services, wire communication, and electronic communication, including information contained therein, to ensure its availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and nonrepudiation.
	- Prevention, protection and restoration
	- Electronic devices and information contained therein
	- Availability, Integrity, Authentication, Confidentiality, and nonrepudiation.

## Security Business

US Federal Communications Commission (FCC):
- Internet allows businesses of all sizes, types, industires and from any location.
- Cybersecurity should be part of the plan of any of this business.
	- Protect their technologies, data, and people from cyber attacks.

### Federal Trade Commision → Cybersecurity for small business

# History of Cybersecurity

## History of Computer Viruses and Worms
1. John von Neumann → 
	1. “Theory of self-reproducing automata”
3. 1968 → Development of the ARPANET
4. 1970s and 1980s computers and internet still under development
5. 1971 → Creeper: Robert Thomas, BBN technologies → Program capable of moving in a network and leaving behind a trail.
	1. Invention of first computer worm → 🪱 Creeper
6. 1974 → Wabbit 🐰 →
	1. Virus that made continual copies of itself
7. 1975 → John Walker wrote the ANIMAL for UNIVAC 1108
	1. First non-malicious Trojans 🐴
8. 1986 → Brain MS-DOS virus 👾
9. 1988 → Robert T. Morris, Cornwell University 🐛
	1. Infection of UNOX systems → the worm propagated across a set of networks
	2. First on receiving full media coverage
10. 1990s → Raise of computer’s viruses
11. 2000 → I LOVE YOU 

## Key Events in Cybersecurity History

![[Pasted image 20231221181535.png]]

1. 1975 → “The Protection of Inforamation in Computer Systems” published
2. 1983 - ==RSA== Patent
3. 1986 - The Cuckoo’s egg and Clifford Stoll
4. 1986 - US Computer Fraud and Abuse Act ( #CFAA )
5. 1990 - UK computer Misuse Act
6. 2001 - Advanced Encryption Standard ( #AES ) established by NIST

# Cybersecurity Environments, tools ,and websites

Windows’ built-in security tools
- Control Panel
- Computer management
- Local security policies
Other tools to use as a cybersecurity professional
- Sysinternals Suite
- Windows God Mode
- Autoruns
- NMap - network manager
- 7-zip

# Cybersecurity Overview

- Computer are everywhere → Internet of Things
	- IoT → Anything that is connected to a network
		- Cloud → Enable systems, apps, and data to be reached from anywhere using almost any device.
- Apps and websites contain sensitive data → Targets for threats

Growth of the Cybersecurity Market
- By 2024 → Expected to grow to $300-billion
	- Hardware, software, Security operations center
	- From 120 billion to 300 billion by 2024

### Cybersecurity Market size to value $900 Bn by 2032
