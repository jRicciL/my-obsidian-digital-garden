# SQL introduction

- Need to know how to retrieve data
- Ask the right questions
- Provide valuable insights out of the data
- Identify SQL syntax
- Work with different types of data
- Create new tables and move data through them
- Practice new skills with programming assignments
- Interpreter structure, meaning, and relationships between data

## Selecting and Retrieving Data
### Module Objectives
- Define and discuss how SQL differs from other computer languages
- Discuss how SQL is used within databases
- Compare and contrast the roles of a database administrator and data scientist
- Explain data relationships within databases

## What is SQL?

==Structured Query Language==:
- Is a standard computer language for relational database management and data manipulation
- Used to query, insert, update, and modify data.
- Pronounced as sequel
- Used to *communicate* with databases
- Statements are made up of descriptive words and are easy to learn
- SQL is a non-procedural language:
	- We cannot write compleate applications
	- Simple, but powerful

### How is SQL used?
- ðŸ”´  ==Read/retrieve== data
- ðŸ”µ  ==Write data==
- ðŸŸ¢  ==Update data==

### How data scientist use SQL?
 #### Database Administrator or Data Scientist
 
<mark style='background-color: #FFA793 !important'> Database Administrator:</mark>
 - Manages/governs entire database
 - Gives permissions to users
 - Determines access to data
 - Manages and creates tables
 - Uses SQL to query and retrieve data

==Data Scientist:==
- End user of a database
- Uses SQL to query and retrieve data
- Writes complex queries for analysis
- Combine multiple sources together
- The main thing for using SQL
	- Data retrieval

### Thinking about your data

> ðŸ§  Think before you do!!

#### Understand your data
- Understand the business process or subject matter the data is modeled after
- Know the business rules
- Understand how your data is organized and structured in the table

#### WHy this is worthwhile
- Get more accurate results
- Speed up your work
- Have less rework

### Databases and Tables

- **Database**:
	- A ==container== to store organized data
	- A set of related information
- **Tables**:
	- A structured list of data elements or a specific type
	- *Columns*:
		- A single field in a table
	- *Rows*:
		- A record in a table

### The evolution of data modeling
- ==Data modeling==:
	- Organizes and **structures information** into multiple, related tables
	- Can represent a business process or show relationships between business processes
	- Should closely represent real world

#### Types of Data models
1. Models for prediction build by data scientists
2. Data model as data tables represetned and organized in a database

#### The evolution of data models
1.  Hierarchical
2.  Network
3.  Relational:
	- Simplifies the connections between the data 
	- Easily allows to write queries, retrieve info, update, and write data
4.  Entity Relationship
5.  Semantic
6.  Object-Oriented
7.  Extended Relational
8.  NoSql
	- BigData =>
