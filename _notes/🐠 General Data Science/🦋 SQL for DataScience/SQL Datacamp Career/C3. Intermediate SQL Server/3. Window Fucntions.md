# Windowing functions
- Process groups of data using sliding windows

### Window Syntax in T-SQL

- Create the window with `OVER` clause
- `PARTITION BY` creates the frame
- If you do not include `PARTITION BY` the frame is the entire table
- To arrange the results, use `ORDER BY`
- Allows aggregations to be created at the same time as the window

```sql
--Create a Window data grouping
OVER (PARTITION BY SalesYear ORDER BY SalesYear)
```

```sql
SELECT SalesPerson, 
		SalesYear, 
		CurrentQuota,
		SUM(CurrentQuote) -- We can use other aggregations
		OVER (PARTITION BY SalesYear) AS YearlyTotal,
		ModifiedDate AS ModDate
FROM SaleGoal
```

#### Examples

```sql
SELECT OrderID, TerritoryName, 
       -- Total price for each partition
       SUM(OrderPrice) 
       -- Create the window and partitions
       OVER (PARTITION BY TerritoryName) AS TotalPrice
FROM Orders
```

## Common Window functions

### `FIRST_VALUE()` and `LAST_VALUE()`

- Return the first and the last value in the window, respectively.
- They need to be combined with `ORDER BY` statement because the order determines the positions inside the window

```sql
SELECT SalesPerson, SalesYear, CurrentData,
	-- First value from every window
	FIRST_VALUE(CurrentQuota)
	OVER (PARTITION BY SalesYear ORDER BY ModifiedDate) AS StartQuota,
	-- Last value from every window
	OVER (PARTITION BY SalesYear ORDER BY ModifiedDate) AS EndQuota,
	ModifiedDate AS ModDate
FROM SaleGoal
```



### Getting the next and prev values with `LEAD()` and `LAG()`
- `LAG()` and `LEAD()`
- Provides the ability to query the value from the next or previous row
	- Can create another column
	- Always gets a `NULL` value
- Requires the use of `ORDER BY` to order the rows

```sql
SELECT SalesPerson, SalesYear, CurrentQuota,
	-- Create a window function to get the values from the next row
	LEAD(CurrentQuota)
	OVER (PARTITION BY SalesYear ORDER BY ModifiedData) AS NextQuota,
	ModifiedDate AS ModDate
FROM SaleGoal
```

```sql
SELECT TerritoryName, OrderDate, 
       -- Specify the previous OrderDate in the window
       LAG(OrderDate) 
       -- Over the window, partition by territory & order by order date
       OVER (PARTITION BY TerritoryName ORDER BY OrderDate) AS PreviousOrder,
       -- Specify the next OrderDate in the window
       LEAD(OrderDate) 
       -- Create the partitions and arrange the rows
       OVER (PARTITION BY TerritoryName ORDER BY OrderDate) AS NextOrder
FROM Orders
```

## Adding row numbers
- Use `ROW_NUMBER()` to sequentially number the rows in the window
- `ORDER BY` is required

## Using Windows for Statistical Functions

### Calculate the standard deviation => `STDEV()`
- `STDEV` can be computed for windows or for the entire table (column)

### Calculate the MODE
- Create a CTE containing an ordered **count** of values using `ROW_NUMBER`
- Write a query using the CTE to pick the value with the highest row number

```sql
-- CTE from the previous exercise
WITH ModePrice (OrderPrice, UnitPriceFrequency)
AS
(
	SELECT OrderPrice,
	ROW_NUMBER() 
    OVER (PARTITION BY OrderPrice ORDER BY OrderPrice) AS UnitPriceFrequency
	FROM Orders
)

-- Select the order price from the CTE
SELECT OrderPrice AS ModeOrderPrice
FROM ModePrice
-- Select the maximum UnitPriceFrequency from the CTE
WHERE UnitPriceFrequency IN (SELECT MAX(UnitPriceFrequency) FROM ModePrice)
```
