# Summarizing Data

## Data Analysis with aggregations
### Common summary Statistics

- `MIN()` 
- `MAX()`
- `AVG()`

#### Examples
- Calculate summary statistics for Mexico
```sql
SELECT
	AVG(InternetUse) AS MeanInternetUse,
	MIN(InternetUse) AS MINInternet,
	MAX(InternetUse) AS MAXInternet,
FROM EconomicIndicators
WHERE Country = 'Mexico'
```

- Another example using `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`
	- To filter even further, for example, to find the values for states where the maximum value is greater than 10, you can use theÂ `HAVING`Â clause.
```sql
SELECT
	AVG(InternetUse) AS MeanInternetUse,
	MIN(InternetUse) AS MINInternet,
	MAX(InternetUse) AS MAXInternet,
FROM EconomicIndicators
GROUP BY Country
HAVING MAX(InternetUse) > 100
```

- Another example

```sql
-- Calculate the aggregations by Shape
SELECT Shape,
       AVG(DurationSeconds) AS Average, 
       MIN(DurationSeconds) AS Minimum, 
       MAX(DurationSeconds) AS Maximum
FROM Incidents
GROUP BY Shape
-- Return records where minimum of DurationSeconds is greater than 1
HAVING MIN(DurationSeconds) > 1
```

## Dealing with missing data

- When there is no data, the empty field contains `NULL`
- `NULL` is not a number, so it is not possible to use operators on it.
- To determine if there is missing data:
	- `IS NULL`
	- `IS NOT NULL`
- For string type columns => Blank is not equal to NULL

### Returning `NOT NULL` values
- Combine with `WHEN`

```sql
SELECT 
	Country, 
	InternetUse, 
	Year
FROM
	EconomicInidicators
WHERE 
	InternetUse 
IS NOT NULL
```

### Substituting missing data with a value

#### `ISNULL`
- ðŸ”´ Use the `ISNULL` function to substitute a `NULL` value with a given value

```sql
SELECT
	GDP, Country
	ISNULL(Country, 'Unknown') AS NewCountry
FROM
	EconomicIndicators
```

- Substitute values from one column for another with `ISNULL`
	- This will happen only with there is a null value
##### Example

```sql
-- Check the IncidentState column for missing values and replace them with the City column
SELECT 
    IncidentState, 
    ISNULL(IncidentState, City) AS Location
FROM Incidents
-- Filter to only return missing values from IncidentState
WHERE IncidentState IS NULL
```

#### `COALESCE`
- `COALESCE` returns the first **non-missing** value

```sql
-- Replace missing values 
SELECT 
    Country, 
    COALESCE(IncidentState, City, 'Unknown') AS Location
FROM Incidents
WHERE Country IS NULL
```

## Binning Data with CASE
- More about `CASE` => [[1. CASE statement]]

![[Captura de Pantalla 2022-05-05 a la(s) 21.43.36.png]]

#### Example
```sql
SELECT Continent,
CASE WHEN Continent = 'Europe' OR Continent = 'Asia'
 	 THEN 'Eurasia'
	 ELSE Continent
	 END AS NewContinent
FROM EconomicIndicators
```

#### CASE can be used to bin the data

```sql
-- Complete the syntax for cutting the duration into different cases
SELECT DurationSeconds, 
-- Start with the 2 TSQL keywords, and after the condition a TSQL word and a value
      CASE WHEN (DurationSeconds <= 120) THEN 1
-- The pattern repeats with the same keyword and after the condition the same word and next value          
       WHEN (DurationSeconds > 120 AND DurationSeconds <= 600) THEN 2
-- Use the same syntax here             
       WHEN (DurationSeconds > 601 AND DurationSeconds <= 1200) THEN 3
-- Use the same syntax here               
       WHEN (DurationSeconds > 1201 AND DurationSeconds <= 5000) THEN 4
-- Specify a value      
       ELSE 5 
       END AS SecondGroup   
FROM Incidents
```

## Counts and Totals => `SUM` and `COUNT`

- Count the number of records (rows)

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table
```

- Count the number of unique values
```sql
SELECT 
	COUNT(DISTINCT col_name) 
FROM table_name
```

##### Examples

```sql
-- Write a query that returns an aggregation 
SELECT 
    MixDesc, 
    SUM(Quantity) AS Total
FROM Shipments
-- Group by the relevant column
GROUP BY MixDesc

```

```sql
-- Count the number of rows by MixDesc
SELECT MixDesc, COUNT(*)
FROM Shipments
GROUP BY MixDesc`sql
```


#### `ORDER BY` and `ASC` and `DESC`

## Math Dates => `DATEPART`
- `DATEPART` is used to determine what part of the date you want to calculate.
	- `DD` for day
	- `MM` for month
	- `YY` for Year
	- `HH` for Hour

### Common date functions in T-SQL
- `DATEADD()` => Add or subtract datetime values
	- Always returns a date	
	- Has three arguments:
		- `DEPART`: Unit of measurement
		- `number`: An integer value to add
		- `date`: A datetime value
		
```sql
-- Return the DeliveryDate as 5 days after the ShipDate
SELECT OrderDate, 
       DATEADD(DD, 5, ShipDate) AS DeliveryDate
FROM Shipments
```

- `DATEDIFF()` => Obtain the difference between two datetime values
	- Always returns a number
	- Has three arguments:
		- `datepart`: Unit of measurement
		- `startdate`
		- `enddate`

![[Captura de Pantalla 2022-05-05 a la(s) 22.02.40.png]]

```sql
-- Return the difference in OrderDate and ShipDate
SELECT OrderDate, ShipDate, 
       DATEDIFF(DD, OrderDate, ShipDate) AS Duration
FROM Shipments
```

## Rounding and Truncating numbers

### Round
- Number on the left and the right of the decimal point can be rounded
	- `ROUND(column, LEN` => Where `LEN` is a number
	- If the number is *positive* it rounds the decimal part
	- If the number is *negative*, it rounds the integer part

![[Captura de Pantalla 2022-05-05 a la(s) 22.08.15.png]]

### Truncating
- Also uses `ROUND`:
	- It uses a third argument that is a non-zero number

```sql
-- Truncate cost to whole number
SELECT Cost, 
       ROUND(Cost, 0, 1) AS TruncateCost
FROM Shipments
```

## More math functions
- Absolute value => `ABS(column)`
- Root square => `SQRT`
- Square of a number => `SQUARE`
- Log => `LOG`, the default base is $e$
	- Apply LOG to zero values will return an error
