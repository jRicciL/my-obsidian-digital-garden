# SQL Complex Queries

## Using variables in SQL
- T-SQL supports different types of variables
	- `VARCHAR(n)`
	- `INT` => Values from -2,147,483,647 to +2,147,483,647
	- `DECIMAL(p, s)` or `NUMEROACAL(p, s)`
		- p = total number of decimal digits that will be stored (left and right)
		- s = number of decimal digits to the right

### Variable creation
1. use `DECLARE`
2. then use `SET` or `SELECT` to assign the value

```sql
-- Declare the variable
DECALRE @Snack VARCHAR(10)
-- Use SET or SELECT to assign the value
SET @Snack = 'Coockies'
-- Show the value
SELECT @Snack

```

## WHILE loops
- Processing data using `WHILE` loops
- While loops work the same way as in other languages

```sql
--Declare the var as an integer
DECLARE @var INT
-- Assign a value
SET @var = 1
-- Specify the condition of the WHILE loop
WHILE @var < 10
	-- Begin the code execution
	BEGIN
		--Keep incrementing @var
		SET @var = @var + 1
		IF @var < 2
			CONTINUE
			
		-- Do extra computation when
		-- @var is > 2
		
		-- Evaluate a condition to break the while loop
		IF @var > 5
			BREAK
		
	END
-- View the value after the loop
SELECT @var
```

## Derived Tables
Used to compute complex queries divided them into small pieces
- Query which is treated like a temporary table
- Always contained within the main query
- They are specified in the `FROM` clause
- Can contain intermediate calculations to be used the main query or in different joins than in the main query

```sql
SELECT
	a.RecordId,
	a.Age,
	a.BloodGlucoseRandom,
	-- FROM dereived table
	b.MaxGlucose
FROM 
	Kidney a
	JOIN (SELECT 
		  	Age, 
		  	MAX(BloodGlucoseRandom) AS MaxGlucose 
		  FROM Kidney GROUP BY Age) b
	ON a.Age == b.Age
	
```

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Kidney a
-- JOIN and create the derived table
JOIN (SELECT Age, MAX(BloodPressure) AS MaxBloodPressure FROM Kidney GROUP BY Age) b
-- JOIN on BloodPressure equal to MaxBloodPressure
ON a.BloodPressure = b.MaxBloodPressure
-- Join on Age
AND a.Age = b.Age
```

## Common Table Expressions
- Common Table Expressions => `CTEs` => Are another type of derived tables
- Can be used multiple times inside the query
	- They are defined using `WITH`
- Syntax:

```sql
-- CTE definitions start with the keyword WITH
-- Followed by the CTE names and the columns it contains
WITH CTEName (Col1, Col2)
AS
-- Define the CTE query
(
-- 
	SELECT Col1, Col2
	FROM TableName
)
```

#### Examples

```sql
-- Specify the keyowrds to create the CTE
WITH BloodGlucoseRandom (MaxGlucose) 
AS (SELECT MAX(BloodGlucoseRandom) AS MaxGlucose FROM Kidney)

SELECT a.Age, b.MaxGlucose
FROM Kidney a
-- Join the CTE on blood glucose equal to max blood glucose
JOIN BloodGlucoseRandom b
ON a.BloodGlucoseRandom = b.MaxGlucose
```

```sql
-- Create the CTE
WITH BloodPressure 
AS (SELECT MAX(BloodPressure) AS MaxBloodPressure FROM Kidney)

SELECT *
FROM Kidney a
-- Join the CTE  
JOIN BloodPressure b
ON a.BloodPressure = b.MaxBloodPressure
```
