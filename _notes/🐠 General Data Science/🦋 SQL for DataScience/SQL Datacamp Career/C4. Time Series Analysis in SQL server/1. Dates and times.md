# Time Series Analysis in SQL Server

## Working with dates and times

- Translate strings to dates
- Filtering, grouping, and aggregating data
- Upsampling and downsampling data
- Window functions

### Building a date

```sql
SELECT
	GETDATE() AS DateTime_LTz, -- Local date time
	GETUTCDATE() AS DateTime_UTC; -- UTC date time
```


```sql
SELECT
	SYSDATETIME() AS DateTime_LTz, -- Local date time
	SYSUTCDATETIME() AS DateTime_UTC; -- UTC date time
```

### Breaking down a date
- Use `DATETIME2(x)`: Where `x` is used to define the number of fractional seconds precision

```sql
DECLARE
	@SomeDate DATETIME2(3) = '2019-03-01 08:17:19.332'
	
SELECT YEAR(@SomeDate)

SELECT MONTH(@SomeDate)

SELECT DAY(@SomeDate)
```

```sql
DECLARE
	@SomeTime DATETIME2(7) = SYSUTCDATETIME();

-- Retrieve the year, month, and day
SELECT
	YEAR(@SomeTime) AS TheYear,
	MONTH(@SomeTime) AS TheMonth,
	DAY(@SomeTime) AS TheDay;
```

### Parsing dates with date parts => `PARTS`
- Use `DATEPART()` => To get a numerical value
- use `DATENAME()` => To get the string representation

##### DatePart

```sql
DECLARE
	@BerlinWallFalls DATETIME2(7) = '1989-11-09 23:49:36.2294852';

-- Fill in each date part
SELECT
	DATEPART(YEAR, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheYear,
	DATEPART(MONTH, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheMonth,
	DATEPART(DAY, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheDay,
	DATEPART(DAYOFYEAR, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheDayOfYear,
    -- Day of week is WEEKDAY
	DATEPART(WEEKDAY, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheDayOfWeek,
	DATEPART(WEEK, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheWeek,
	DATEPART(SECOND, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheSecond,
	DATEPART(NANOSECOND, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheNanosecond;
```

##### DateName
- Gives different results from `DATEPART` with `month` and `dayOfWeek`

```sql
DECLARE
	@BerlinWallFalls DATETIME2(7) = '1989-11-09 23:49:36.2294852';

-- Fill in the function to show the name of each date part
SELECT
	DATENAME(YEAR, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheYear,
	DATENAME(MONTH, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheMonth,
	DATENAME(DAY, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheDay,
	DATENAME(DAYOFYEAR, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheDayOfYear,
    -- Day of week is WEEKDAY
	DATENAME(WEEKDAY, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheDayOfWeek,
	DATENAME(WEEK, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheWeek,
	DATENAME(SECOND, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheSecond,
	DATENAME(NANOSECOND, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheNanosecond;
```

### Adding and subtracting dates
#### Comparing dates

- Use `DATEDIFF` and `DATEADD` =>
	- It returns an integer and rounds up

##### `DATEADD`

```sql
DECLARE
	@LeapDay DATETIME2(7) = '2012-02-29 18:00:00';

-- Fill in the date parts and intervals as needed
SELECT
	DATEADD(DAY, -1, @LeapDay) AS PriorDay,
	DATEADD(DAY, 1, @LeapDay) AS NextDay,
    -- For leap years, we need to move 4 years, not just 1
	DATEADD(YEAR, -4, @LeapDay) AS PriorLeapYear,
	DATEADD(YEAR, 4, @LeapDay) AS NextLeapYear,
	DATEADD(YEAR, -1, @LeapDay) AS PriorYear;
```

```sql
DECLARE
	@PostLeapDay DATETIME2(7) = '2012-03-01 18:00:00';

-- Fill in the date parts and intervals as needed
SELECT
	DATEADD(DAY, -1, @PostLeapDay) AS PriorDay,
	DATEADD(DAY, 1, @PostLeapDay) AS NextDay,
	DATEADD(YEAR, -4, @PostLeapDay) AS PriorLeapYear,
	DATEADD(YEAR, 4, @PostLeapDay) AS NextLeapYear,
	DATEADD(YEAR, -1, @PostLeapDay) AS PriorYear,
    -- Move 4 years forward and one day back
	DATEADD(DAY, -1, DATEADD(YEAR, 4, @PostLeapDay)) AS NextLeapDay,
    DATEADD(DAY, -2, @PostLeapDay) AS TwoDaysAgo;
```

##### `DATEDIFF`

```sql
DECLARE
	@PostLeapDay DATETIME2(7) = '2012-03-01 18:00:00',
    @TwoDaysAgo DATETIME2(7);

SELECT
	@TwoDaysAgo = DATEADD(DAY, -2, @PostLeapDay);

SELECT
	@TwoDaysAgo AS TwoDaysAgo,
	@PostLeapDay AS SomeTime,
    -- Fill in the appropriate function and date types
	DATEDIFF(DAY, @TwoDaysAgo, @PostLeapDay) AS DaysDifference,
	DATEDIFF(HOUR, @TwoDaysAgo, @PostLeapDay) AS HoursDifference,
	DATEDIFF(MINUTE, @TwoDaysAgo, @PostLeapDay) AS MinutesDifference;
```

#### Round dates

```sql
DECLARE
	@SomeTime DATETIME2(7) = '2018-06-14 16:29:36.2248991';

-- Fill in the appropriate functions and date parts
SELECT
	DATEADD(DAY, DATEDIFF(DAY, 0, @SomeTime), 0) AS RoundedToDay,
	DATEADD(HOUR, DATEDIFF(HOUR, 0, @SomeTime), 0) AS RoundedToHour,
	DATEADD(MINUTE, DATEDIFF(MINUTE, 0, @SomeTime), 0) AS RoundedToMinute;
```
