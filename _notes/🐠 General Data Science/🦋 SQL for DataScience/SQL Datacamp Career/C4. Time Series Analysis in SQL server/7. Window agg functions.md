# Aggregation functions over windows

### Ranking window functions
- `RANK_NUMBER()`
	- Unique, ascending integer value starting from 1
- `RANK
	- Not guarantied to be unique
		- Allow duplicates with tie values are present
	- Ascending integer value starting from 1.
	- Can have ties
	- **Can skip numbers** 
- `DENSE_RANK()`	
	- Ascending integer value starting from 1.
	- Can have ties
	- **Will not skip numbers**

### Calculating row numbers
- All ranking functions have the same syntax

```sql
SELECT
	ir.IncidentDate,
	ir.NumberOfIncidents,
    -- Fill in each window function and ordering
    -- Note that all of these are in descending order!
	ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY ir.NumberOfIncidents DESC) AS rownum,
	RANK() OVER (ORDER BY ir.NumberOfIncidents DESC) AS rk,
	DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY ir.NumberOfIncidents DESC) AS dr
FROM dbo.IncidentRollup ir
WHERE
	ir.IncidentTypeID = 3
	AND ir.NumberOfIncidents >= 8
ORDER BY
	ir.NumberOfIncidents DESC;
```

### Partitions
- Use another column as a kind of *group by* step before computing the row ranks
	- In the example below, we computed the ranks by team

```sql
SELECT
	s.Team,
	s.RunScored,
	ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
		PARTITION BY s.Team
		ORDER BY s.RunScored DESC
	) AS rn
FROM dbo.Scores s
ORDER BY
	s.RunScored DESC;
```

### `PARTITION` to Aggregate functions

```sql
SELECT
	s.Team,
	s.RunScored,
	MAX(s.RunScored) OVER (
		PARTITION BY s.TEam
	) AS MaxRuns
FROM dbo.Scores s
ORDER BY
	s.RunScored DESC;
```

## Calculating running totals and moving averages

### Calculating running totals 
-- Rolling sum --

![[Captura de Pantalla 2022-07-03 a la(s) 18.23.04.png]]

```sql
SELECT
	-- Select the rows we are interested in
	s.Team,
	s.Game,
	s.RunScored,
	-- Perform the Running sum using SUM and OVER
	SUM(s.RunScored) OVER (
		-- Use PARTITION to compute by group
		PARTITION BY s.Team
		-- ORDER BY will be used to order the rows
		ORDER BY s.Game ASC
		-- NOW define the running window
		RANGE BETWEEN
			-- The preceding expression (how far back)
			UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
			-- And how further *the present row, in this case*
			AND CURRENT ROW
	) AS TotalRuns
FROM Scores s
```

## Window FRAMES

In addition to the 	`PARTITION BY` and `ORDER BY` clauses, window functions can include frames which tell the database engine what we include as relevant to the window.

```sql
SELECT
    ir.IncidentDate,
    ir.IncidentTypeID,
    SUM(ir.NumberOfIncidents) OVER (
        PARTITION BY ir.IncidentTypeID
        ORDER BY ir.IncidentDate
        --
			-- 
			<< WINDOW FRAME >> See image below
			--
		--
    ) AS NumberOfIncidents
FROM dbo.IncidentRollup ir;
```

### Examples

#### Example 1 -> between rows
##### Calculating moving averages

Instead of looking at a running total from the beginning of time until now, management would like to see theÂ **average**Â number of incidents over the past 7 days--that is, starting 6 days ago and ending on the current date. Because this is over a specified frame which changes over the course of our query, this is called aÂ **moving average**.
```sql
SELECT
	ir.IncidentDate,
	ir.IncidentTypeID,
	ir.NumberOfIncidents,
    -- Fill in the correct window function
	AVG(ir.NumberOfIncidents) OVER (
		PARTITION BY ir.IncidentTypeID
		ORDER BY ir.IncidentDate
      	-- Fill in the three parts of the window frame
		ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
	) AS MeanNumberOfIncidents
FROM dbo.IncidentRollup ir
	INNER JOIN dbo.Calendar c
		ON ir.IncidentDate = c.Date
WHERE
	c.CalendarYear = 2019
	AND c.CalendarMonth IN (7, 8)
	AND ir.IncidentTypeID = 1
ORDER BY
	ir.IncidentTypeID,
	ir.IncidentDate;
```

## Working with `LAG()` and `LEAD()`

- Give the ability to link together past, present, and future in the same query.

### `LAG()` window function
- Gives you a prior row in a window given a particular partition strategy and ordering.
	- It takes a parameter as an expression
	- It gives a `NULL` for the first value
	- We can specify the number of rows to look back:
		- `LAG(column, 3)` <- For three rows above

- In other words it creates a new column with the prior values of the current row.

```sql
SELECT
	dsr.CustomerID,
	dsr.MonthStartDate,
	LAG(dsr.NumberOfVisits) OVER (
		PARTITION BY dsr.CustomerID
		ORDER BY dsr.MonthStartDate
	) AS Prior,
	dsr.NumberOfVisits
FROM dbo.DaySpaRollup dsr;
```

![[Captura de Pantalla 2022-07-03 a la(s) 18.41.38.png]]

### `LEAD()` window function

- Similar to `LAG()` but it gives the next value of the current row

```sql
SELECT
	ir.IncidentDate,
	ir.IncidentTypeID,
    -- Get the prior day's number of incidents
	LAG(ir.NumberOfIncidents, 1) OVER (
      	-- Partition by incident type ID
		PARTITION BY ir.IncidentTypeID
      	-- Order by incident date
		ORDER BY ir.IncidentDate
	) AS PriorDayIncidents,
	ir.NumberOfIncidents AS CurrentDayIncidents,
    -- Get the next day's number of incidents
	LEAD(ir.NumberOfIncidents, 1) OVER (
      	-- Partition by incident type ID
		PARTITION BY ir.IncidentTypeID
      	-- Order by incident date
		ORDER BY ir.IncidentDate
	) AS NextDayIncidents
FROM dbo.IncidentRollup ir
WHERE
	ir.IncidentDate >= '2019-07-02'
	AND ir.IncidentDate <= '2019-07-31'
	AND ir.IncidentTypeID IN (1, 2)
ORDER BY
	ir.IncidentTypeID,
	ir.IncidentDate;
```

### Calculating the number of days between incidents -> Using `DATEDIFF`
Something you might have noticed in the prior two exercises is that we don't always have incidents on every day of the week, so callingÂ `LAG()`Â andÂ `LEAD()`Â the "prior day" is a little misleading; it's really the "prior period." Someone in management noticed this as well and, at the end of July, wanted to know the number of days between incidents. To do this, we will calculate two values: the number of days since the prior incident and the number of days until the next incident.

Recall thatÂ `DATEDIFF()`Â gives the difference between two dates. We can combine this withÂ `LAG()`Â andÂ `LEAD()`Â to get our results.

```sql
SELECT
	ir.IncidentDate,
	ir.IncidentTypeID,
    -- Fill in the days since last incident
	DATEDIFF(DAY, 
			 LAG(ir.IncidentDate, 1) OVER (
				PARTITION BY ir.IncidentTypeID
				ORDER BY ir.IncidentDate
				), 
			 ir.IncidentDate) AS DaysSinceLastIncident,
    -- Fill in the days until next incident
	DATEDIFF(DAY, 
			 ir.IncidentDate, 
			 LEAD(ir.IncidentDate, 1) OVER (
				PARTITION BY ir.IncidentTypeID
				ORDER BY ir.IncidentDate
			 	)
			) AS DaysUntilNextIncident
FROM dbo.IncidentRollup ir
WHERE
	ir.IncidentDate >= '2019-07-02'
	AND ir.IncidentDate <= '2019-07-31'
	AND ir.IncidentTypeID IN (1, 2)
ORDER BY
	ir.IncidentTypeID,
	ir.IncidentDate;
```



## Order of execution
- ðŸš¨ `LAG()` and `LEAD()` executes after the `WHERE` clause


#### Solution => #CommonTableExpression
- Use filters and ==Common Table Expression==

## Finding maximum levels of overlap
- Use the data below to determine how many staff we should have in our stores
- Count the maximum number of people in the store at any one time.
	- The data below indicates the time at enter and leave of each person
![[Captura de Pantalla 2022-07-03 a la(s) 19.21.13.png]]

### Step 1
- #CommonTableExpression `StartStopPoints`

```sql
SELECT
	o.StartTime AS TimeUTC,
	1 AS EntryCount, -- initialize with one
	ROW_NUMBER() OVER ( -- Get the Row_number
		ORDER BY o.StartTime
	) AS StartOrdinal -- Order by time
FROM #Orders o
UNION ALL
SELECT
	o.EndTime AS TimeUTC,
	-1 AS EntryCount,
	NULL AS StartOrdinal
FROM #Orders o
	
```

![[Captura de Pantalla 2022-07-03 a la(s) 19.27.08.png]]

### Step 2
- #CommonTableExpression `StartStopOrder`
```sql
SELECT
	s.TimeUTC,
	s.EntryCount,
	s.StartOrdinal,
	ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
		ORDER BY TimeUTC, StartOrdinal
	) AS StartOrEndOrdinal
FROM StartStopPoints s
```

### Step 3

```sql
SELECT
	MAX(2 * s.StartOrdinal - s.StartOrEndOrdinal) AS 
	MAxConcurrentVisitors
FROM StartStopOrder s
WHERE s.EntryCount = 1
```

## Analyze client data for potential fraud
In this final set of exercises, we will analyze day spa data to look for potential fraud. Our company gives each customer one pass for personal use and a single guest pass. We have check-in and check-out data for each client and guest passes tie back to the base customer ID. This means that there might be overlap when a client and guest both check in together. We want to see if there are at least three overlapping entries for a single client, as that would be a violation of our business rule.

### First step

```sql
-- This section focuses on entrances:  CustomerVisitStart
SELECT
	dsv.CustomerID,
	dsv.CustomerVisitStart AS TimeUTC,
	1 AS EntryCount,
    -- We want to know each customer's entrance stream
    -- Get a unique, ascending row number
	ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
      -- Break this out by customer ID
      PARTITION BY dsv.CustomerID
      -- Ordered by the customer visit start date
      ORDER BY dsv.CustomerVisitStart
    ) AS StartOrdinal
FROM dbo.DaySpaVisit dsv
UNION ALL
-- This section focuses on departures:  CustomerVisitEnd
SELECT
	dsv.CustomerID,
	dsv.CustomerVisitEnd AS TimeUTC,
	-1 AS EntryCount,
	NULL AS StartOrdinal
FROM dbo.DaySpaVisit dsv
```

![[Captura de Pantalla 2022-07-03 a la(s) 19.35.39.png]]

### Second step

In the prior exercise, we broke out day spa data into a stream of entrances and exits. Unpivoting the data allows us to move to the next step, which is to order the entire stream.

The results from the prior exercise are now in a temporary table calledÂ `#StartStopPoints`. The columns in this table areÂ `CustomerID`,Â `TimeUTC`,Â `EntryCount`, andÂ `StartOrdinal`.Â **These are the only columns you will need to use in this exercise.**Â `TimeUTC`Â represents the event time,Â `EntryCount`Â indicates the net change for the event (+1 or -1), andÂ `StartOrdinal`Â appears for entrance events and gives the order of entry.

```sql
SELECT s.*,
    -- Build a stream of all check-in and check-out events
	ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
      -- Break this out by customer ID
      PARTITION BY s.CustomerID
      -- Order by event time and then the start ordinal
      -- value (in case of exact time matches)
      ORDER BY s.TimeUTC, s.StartOrdinal
    ) AS StartOrEndOrdinal
FROM #StartStopPoints s;
```

### Step 3

So far, we have broken out day spa data into a stream of entrances and exits and ordered this stream chronologically. This stream contains two critical fields,Â `StartOrdinal`Â andÂ `StartOrEndOrdinal`.Â `StartOrdinal`Â is the chronological ordering of all entrances.Â `StartOrEndOrdinal`Â contains all entrances and exits in order. Armed with these two pieces of information, we can find the maximum number of concurrent visits.

The results from the prior exercise are now in a temporary table calledÂ `#StartStopOrder`.

-   Fill out theÂ `HAVING`Â clause to determine cases with more than 2 concurrent visitors.
-   Fill out theÂ `ORDER BY`Â clause to show management the worst offenders: those with the highest values forÂ `MaxConcurrentCustomerVisits`.

```sql
SELECT
	s.CustomerID,
	MAX(2 * s.StartOrdinal - s.StartOrEndOrdinal) AS MaxConcurrentCustomerVisits
FROM #StartStopOrder s
WHERE s.EntryCount = 1
GROUP BY s.CustomerID
-- The difference between 2 * start ordinal and the start/end
-- ordinal represents the number of concurrent visits
HAVING MAX(2 * s.StartOrdinal - s.StartOrEndOrdinal) > 2
-- Sort by the largest number of max concurrent customer visits
ORDER BY MaxConcurrentCustomerVisits DESC;
```
