# Aggregation functions for time series

- [[SQL - Aggregating data]]

### Key aggregation functions

- `COUNT()`
	- ![[Captura de Pantalla 2022-06-24 a la(s) 19.59.33.png]]
- `COUNT_BIG()`
- `COUNT(DISTINCT)`
	
```sql
SELECT
	COUNT(DISTINCT c.CalendarYear) AS Years,
	COUNT(DISTINCT NULLIF(c.CalendarYear, 2010) as Y2)
FROM dbo.Calendar c;
```
	
- `SUM`

### Filtering aggregates with `CASE`
- GEt the latest incident date from `incidentTypes`
```sql
SELECT
	MAX(CASE WHEN ir.IncidentTypeID = 1
	   	 	 THEN ir.IncidentDate
	   		 ELSE NULL
	   END) AS I1,
	MAX(CASE WHEN ir.IncidentTypeID =2
	   		 THEN ir.IncidentDate
	   		 ELSE NULL
	   END) AS I2,
FROM dbo.IncidentRollup ir;
```

#### Examples

```sql
-- Fill in the appropriate aggregate functions
SELECT
	it.IncidentType,
	COUNT(1) AS NumberOfRows,
	SUM(ir.NumberOfIncidents) AS TotalNumberOfIncidents,
	MIN(ir.NumberOfIncidents) AS MinNumberOfIncidents,
	MAX(ir.NumberOfIncidents) AS MaxNumberOfIncidents,
	MIN(ir.IncidentDate) As MinIncidentDate,
	MAX(ir.IncidentDate) AS MaxIncidentDate
FROM dbo.IncidentRollup ir
	INNER JOIN dbo.IncidentType it
		ON ir.IncidentTypeID = it.IncidentTypeID
WHERE
	ir.IncidentDate BETWEEN '2019-08-01' AND '2019-10-31'
GROUP BY
	it.IncidentType;
```

```sql
-- Fill in the functions and columns
SELECT
	COUNT(DISTINCT ir.IncidentTypeID) AS NumberOfIncidentTypes,
	COUNT(DISTINCT ir.IncidentDate) AS NumberOfDaysWithIncidents
FROM dbo.IncidentRollup ir
WHERE
ir.IncidentDate BETWEEN '2019-08-01' AND '2019-10-31';
```

- If we want to count the number of occurrences of an event given some filter criteria, we can take advantage of aggregate functions like `SUM()`, `MIN()`, and `MAX()`, as well as `CASE` expressions. For example, `SUM(CASE WHEN ir.IncidentTypeID = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)` will return the count of incidents associated with incident type 1. If you include one `SUM()` statement for each incident type, you have pivoted the data set by incident type ID.
```sql
SELECT
	it.IncidentType,
    -- Fill in the appropriate expression
	SUM(CASE WHEN ir.NumberOfIncidents > 5 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS NumberOfBigIncidentDays,
    -- Number of incidents will always be at least 1, so
    -- no need to check the minimum value, just that it's
    -- less than or equal to 5
    SUM(CASE WHEN ir.NumberOfIncidents <= 5 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS NumberOfSmallIncidentDays
FROM dbo.IncidentRollup ir
	INNER JOIN dbo.IncidentType it
		ON ir.IncidentTypeID = it.IncidentTypeID
WHERE
	ir.IncidentDate BETWEEN '2019-08-01' AND '2019-10-31'
GROUP BY
it.IncidentType;

```

## Statistical Aggregate functions

![[Captura de Pantalla 2022-06-24 a la(s) 20.09.10.png]]
- SQL Server does not have a median function
- Instead it haves the `PERCENTILE_COUNT()`
	-	The median is computed as `PERCENTILE_COUNT(0.5)`
```sql
SELECT
	PERCENTILE_COUNT(0.5)
		WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY l.SomeVal DESC)
		OVER () AS MedianIncidents
FROM dbo.LargeTable l;
```
![[Captura de Pantalla 2022-06-24 a la(s) 20.12.39.png]]
- Compute the median is very expensive

### Examples

```sql
-- Fill in the missing function names
SELECT
	it.IncidentType,
	AVG(ir.NumberOfIncidents) AS MeanNumberOfIncidents,
	AVG(CAST(ir.NumberOfIncidents AS DECIMAL(4,2))) AS MeanNumberOfIncidents,
	STDEV(ir.NumberOfIncidents) AS NumberOfIncidentsStandardDeviation,
	VAR(ir.NumberOfIncidents) AS NumberOfIncidentsVariance,
	COUNT(1) AS NumberOfRows
FROM dbo.IncidentRollup ir
	INNER JOIN dbo.IncidentType it
		ON ir.IncidentTypeID = it.IncidentTypeID
	INNER JOIN dbo.Calendar c
		ON ir.IncidentDate = c.Date
WHERE
	c.CalendarQuarter = 2
	AND c.CalendarYear = 2020
GROUP BY
it.IncidentType;
```

## Sownsampling and upsampling data
- Downsampling to the nearest hour
![[Captura de Pantalla 2022-06-24 a la(s) 20.19.02.png]]

![[Captura de Pantalla 2022-06-24 a la(s) 20.20.26.png]]

```sql
SELECT
	-- Downsample to a daily grain
    -- Cast CustomerVisitStart as a date
	CAST(dsv.CustomerVisitStart AS DATE) AS Day,
	SUM(dsv.AmenityUseInMinutes) AS AmenityUseInMinutes,
	COUNT(1) AS NumberOfAttendees
FROM dbo.DaySpaVisit dsv
WHERE
	dsv.CustomerVisitStart >= '2020-06-11'
	AND dsv.CustomerVisitStart < '2020-06-23'
GROUP BY
	-- When we use aggregation functions like SUM or COUNT,
    -- we need to GROUP BY the non-aggregated columns
	CAST(dsv.CustomerVisitStart AS DATE)
ORDER BY
	Day;
```

- Downsample the day spa visit data to a weekly grain using the `DATEPART()` function.
-   Find the customer with the largest customer ID for a given week.
-   Fill in the `GROUP BY` clause with any non-aggregated values in the `SELECT` clause (but without aliases like `AS Week`).

```sql
SELECT
	-- Downsample to a weekly grain
	DATEPART(WEEK, dsv.CustomerVisitStart) AS Week,
	SUM(dsv.AmenityUseInMinutes) AS AmenityUseInMinutes,
	-- Find the customer with the largest customer ID for that week
	MAX(dsv.CustomerID) AS HighestCustomerID,
	COUNT(1) AS NumberOfAttendees
FROM dbo.DaySpaVisit dsv
WHERE
	dsv.CustomerVisitStart >= '2020-01-01'
	AND dsv.CustomerVisitStart < '2021-01-01'
GROUP BY
	-- When we use aggregation functions like SUM or COUNT,
    -- we need to GROUP BY the non-aggregated columns
	DATEPART(WEEK, dsv.CustomerVisitStart)
ORDER BY
	Week;
```

#### Downsample using a calendar table

-   Find and include the week of the calendar year.
-   Include the minimum value of `c.Date` in each group as `FirstDateOfWeek`. This works because we are grouping by week.
-   Join the `Calendar` table to the `DaySpaVisit` table based on the calendar table's date and each day spa customer's date of visit. `CustomerVisitStart` is a `DATETIME2` which includes time, so a direct join would only include visits starting at exactly midnight.
-   Group by the week of calendar year.

```sql
SELECT
	-- Determine the week of the calendar year
	c.CalendarWeekOfYear,
	-- Determine the earliest DATE in this group
    -- This is NOT the DayOfWeek column
	MIN(c.Date) AS FirstDateOfWeek,
	ISNULL(SUM(dsv.AmenityUseInMinutes), 0) AS AmenityUseInMinutes,
	ISNULL(MAX(dsv.CustomerID), 0) AS HighestCustomerID,
	COUNT(dsv.CustomerID) AS NumberOfAttendees
FROM dbo.Calendar c
	LEFT OUTER JOIN dbo.DaySpaVisit dsv
		-- Connect dbo.Calendar with dbo.DaySpaVisit
		-- To join on CustomerVisitStart, we need to turn 
        -- it into a DATE type
		ON c.Date = CAST(dsv.CustomerVisitStart AS DATE)
WHERE
	c.CalendarYear = 2020
GROUP BY
	-- When we use aggregation functions like SUM or COUNT,
    -- we need to GROUP BY the non-aggregated columns
	c.CalendarWeekOfYear
ORDER BY
	c.CalendarWeekOfYear;
```

## Grouping by ROLLUP, CUBE, and GRUPING SETS

### Hierarchical rollups with `ROLLUP`
- used for summary hierarchical data
- The `ROLLUP` operator works best when your non-measure attributes are hierarchical. Otherwise, you may end up weird aggregation levels which don't make intuitive sense.
- It is used after `GROUP BY`
![[Captura de Pantalla 2022-06-24 a la(s) 20.30.46.png]]

```sql
SELECT
	c.CalendarYear,
	c.CalendarQuarterName,
	c.CalendarMonth,
    -- Include the sum of incidents by day over each range
	SUM(ir.NumberOfIncidents) AS NumberOfIncidents
FROM dbo.IncidentRollup ir
	INNER JOIN dbo.Calendar c
		ON ir.IncidentDate = c.Date
WHERE
	ir.IncidentTypeID = 2
GROUP BY
	-- GROUP BY needs to include all non-aggregated columns
	c.CalendarYear,
	c.CalendarQuarterName,
	c.CalendarMonth
-- Fill in your grouping operator
WITH ROLLUP
ORDER BY
	c.CalendarYear,
	c.CalendarQuarterName,
	c.CalendarMonth;
```


### `CUBE` Full combination of the columns

![[Captura de Pantalla 2022-06-24 a la(s) 20.31.54.png]]

```sql
SELECT
	-- Use the ORDER BY clause as a guide for these columns
    -- Don't forget that comma after the third column if you
    -- copy from the ORDER BY clause!
	ir.IncidentTypeID,
	c.CalendarQuarterName,
	c.WeekOfMonth,
	SUM(ir.NumberOfIncidents) AS NumberOfIncidents
FROM dbo.IncidentRollup ir
	INNER JOIN dbo.Calendar c
		ON ir.IncidentDate = c.Date
WHERE
	ir.IncidentTypeID IN (3, 4)
GROUP BY
	-- GROUP BY should include all non-aggregated columns
	ir.IncidentTypeID,
	c.CalendarQuarterName,
	c.WeekOfMonth
-- Fill in your grouping operator
WITH CUBE
ORDER BY
	ir.IncidentTypeID,
	c.CalendarQuarterName,
	c.WeekOfMonth;
```

### Grouping sets => `GROUPING SETS`

![[Captura de Pantalla 2022-06-24 a la(s) 20.32.26.png]]

```sql
SELECT
	c.CalendarYear,
	c.CalendarQuarterName,
	c.CalendarMonth,
	SUM(ir.NumberOfIncidents) AS NumberOfIncidents
FROM dbo.IncidentRollup ir
	INNER JOIN dbo.Calendar c
		ON ir.IncidentDate = c.Date
WHERE
	ir.IncidentTypeID = 2
-- Fill in your grouping operator here
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS
(
  	-- Group in hierarchical order:  calendar year,
    -- calendar quarter name, calendar month
	(CalendarYear, CalendarQuarterName, CalendarMonth),
  	-- Group by calendar year
	(CalendarYear),
    -- This remains blank; it gives us the grand total
	()
)
ORDER BY
	c.CalendarYear,
	c.CalendarQuarterName,
	c.CalendarMonth;
```
