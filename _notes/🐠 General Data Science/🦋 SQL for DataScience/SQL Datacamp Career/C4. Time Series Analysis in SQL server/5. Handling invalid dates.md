# Handling invalid dates
## Error-safe date conversion functions
![[Captura de Pantalla 2022-06-21 a la(s) 21.01.17.png]]

#### Safe cuntions
- `TRY_CAST()`
- `TRY_CONVERT()`
- `TRY_PARSE()`

The above functions will return `null` if the casting fails

### Try out type-safe date functions
- In this exercise, we will try out theÂ `TRY_CONVERT()`,Â `TRY_CAST()`, andÂ `TRY_PARSE()`Â set of functions. 
- Each of these functions will safely parse string data and attempt to convert to another type, returningÂ `NULL`Â if the conversion fails.

```sql
DECLARE
	@GoodDateINTL NVARCHAR(30) = '2019-03-01 18:23:27.920',
	@GoodDateDE NVARCHAR(30) = '13.4.2019',
	@GoodDateUS NVARCHAR(30) = '4/13/2019',
	@BadDate NVARCHAR(30) = N'SOME BAD DATE';

-- The prior solution using TRY_CAST
SELECT
	TRY_CAST(@GoodDateINTL AS DATETIME2(3)) AS GoodDateINTL,
	TRY_CAST(@GoodDateDE AS DATE) AS GoodDateDE,
	TRY_CAST(@GoodDateUS AS DATE) AS GoodDateUS,
	TRY_CAST(@BadDate AS DATETIME2(3)) AS BadDate;

SELECT
	TRY_PARSE(@GoodDateINTL AS DATETIME2(3)) AS GoodDateINTL,
    -- Fill in the correct region based on our input
    -- Be sure to match these data types with the
    -- TRY_CAST() examples above!
	TRY_PARSE(@GoodDateDE AS DATE USING 'de-de') AS GoodDateDE,
	TRY_PARSE(@GoodDateUS AS DATE USING 'en-us') AS GoodDateUS,
    -- TRY_PARSE can't fix completely invalid dates
	TRY_PARSE(@BadDate AS DATETIME2(3) USING 'sk-sk') AS BadDate;
```

### Use time zones when converting dates

```sql
DECLARE
	@GoodDateINTL NVARCHAR(30) = '2019-03-01 18:23:27.920',
	@GoodDateDE NVARCHAR(30) = '13.4.2019',
	@GoodDateUS NVARCHAR(30) = '4/13/2019',
	@BadDate NVARCHAR(30) = N'SOME BAD DATE';

-- The prior solution using TRY_CAST
SELECT
	TRY_CAST(@GoodDateINTL AS DATETIME2(3)) AS GoodDateINTL,
	TRY_CAST(@GoodDateDE AS DATE) AS GoodDateDE,
	TRY_CAST(@GoodDateUS AS DATE) AS GoodDateUS,
	TRY_CAST(@BadDate AS DATETIME2(3)) AS BadDate;

SELECT
	TRY_PARSE(@GoodDateINTL AS DATETIME2(3)) AS GoodDateINTL,
    -- Fill in the correct region based on our input
    -- Be sure to match these data types with the
    -- TRY_CAST() examples above!
	TRY_PARSE(@GoodDateDE AS DATE USING 'de-de') AS GoodDateDE,
	TRY_PARSE(@GoodDateUS AS DATE USING 'en-us') AS GoodDateUS,
    -- TRY_PARSE can't fix completely invalid dates
	TRY_PARSE(@BadDate AS DATETIME2(3) USING 'sk-sk') AS BadDate;
```

### Execution time
- ðŸš¨ `TRY_CAST()`Â andÂ `TRY_CONVERT()`Â are both faster thanÂ `TRY_PARSE()`.

- `TRY_CAST`
```sql
-- Try out how fast the TRY_CAST() function is
-- by try-casting each DateText value to DATE
DECLARE @StartTimeCast DATETIME2(7) = SYSUTCDATETIME();
SELECT TRY_CAST(DateText AS DATE) AS TestDate FROM #DateText;
DECLARE @EndTimeCast DATETIME2(7) = SYSUTCDATETIME();

-- Determine how much time the conversion took by
-- calculating the date difference from @StartTimeCast to @EndTimeCast
SELECT
    DATEDIFF(MILLISECOND, @StartTimeCast, @EndTimeCast) AS ExecutionTimeCast;
```

- `TRY_CONVERT`
```sql
-- Try out how fast the TRY_CONVERT() function is
-- by try-converting each DateText value to DATE
DECLARE @StartTimeConvert DATETIME2(7) = SYSUTCDATETIME();
SELECT TRY_CONVERT(DATE, DateText) AS TestDate FROM #DateText;
DECLARE @EndTimeConvert DATETIME2(7) = SYSUTCDATETIME();

-- Determine how much time the conversion took by
-- calculating the difference from start time to end time
SELECT
    DATEDIFF(MILLISECOND, @StartTimeConvert, @EndTimeConvert) AS ExecutionTimeConvert;
```

- `TRY_PARSE`
```sql
-- Try out how fast the TRY_PARSE() function is
-- by try-parsing each DateText value to DATE
DECLARE @StartTimeParse DATETIME2(7) = SYSUTCDATETIME();
SELECT TRY_PARSE(DateText AS DATE) AS TestDate FROM #DateText;
DECLARE @EndTimeParse DATETIME2(7) = SYSUTCDATETIME();

-- Determine how much time the conversion took by
-- calculating the difference from start time to end time
SELECT
    DATEDIFF(MILLISECOND, @StartTimeParse, @EndTimeParse) AS ExecutionTimeParse;
```
