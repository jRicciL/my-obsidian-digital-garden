## CASE statements
- Contains a `WHEN`, `THEN`, and `ELSE` statement, finished with `END`

```sql
CASE WHEN x < 1 THEN 'a'
	 WHEN x = 2 THEN 'b'
	 ELSE 'c'
	 END
	 AS new_column
```

### Examples

#### EX 1
```sql
-- Identify the home team as Bayern Munich, Schalke 04, or neither
SELECT 
    CASE WHEN hometeam_id = 10189 THEN 'FC Schalke 04'
         WHEN hometeam_id = 9823 THEN 'FC Bayern Munich'
         ELSE 'Other' END AS home_team,
	COUNT(id) AS total_matches
FROM matches_germany
-- Group by the CASE statement alias
GROUP BY home_team;
```

```
team_long_name	    team_api_id
FC Bayern Munich	9823
FC Schalke 04	    10189
```

#### EX 2
- In this exercise, you will be creating a list of matches in the 2011/2012 season where Barcelona was the _home team_.
- Use a `CASE` statement that compares the values of two columns to create a new group -- wins, losses, and ties.
- Filter for matches where the home team is _FC Barcelona_ (id = `8634`).

```sql
SELECT 
	m.date,
	t.team_long_name AS opponent,
    -- Complete the CASE statement with an alias
	CASE WHEN m.home_goal > m.away_goal THEN 'Barcelona win!'
         WHEN m.home_goal < m.away_goal THEN 'Barcelona loss :(' 
         ELSE 'Tie' END AS outcome 
FROM matches_spain AS m
LEFT JOIN teams_spain AS t 
ON m.awayteam_id = t.team_api_id
-- Filter for Barcelona as the home team
WHERE m.hometeam_id = 8634; 
```

## More complex queries
- Add multiple logical conditions to the `WHEN` clause

```sql
-- Select the season, date, home_goal, and away_goal columns
SELECT 
	season,
    date,
	home_goal,
	away_goal
FROM matches_italy
WHERE 
-- Exclude games not won by Bologna
	CASE WHEN hometeam_id = 9857 AND home_goal > away_goal THEN 'Bologna Win'
		WHEN awayteam_id = 9857 AND away_goal > home_goal THEN 'Bologna Win' 
		END IS NOT NULL;
```

## CASE WHEN with aggregate functions
- `COUNT`ing cases

```sql
SELECT
	season,
	COUNT(
		CASE WHEN ...
		THEN ...
		ELSE ...
		END 
	) AS new_col_with_counts
FROM table
GROUP BY season
```

```sql
SELECT 
	c.name AS country,
    -- Count games from the 2012/2013 season
	COUNT(CASE WHEN m.season = '2012/2013' 
        	   THEN m.id 
			   ELSE NULL 
			   END) AS matches_2012_2013
FROM country AS c
LEFT JOIN match AS m
ON c.id = m.country_id
-- Group by country name alias
GROUP BY country;
```
