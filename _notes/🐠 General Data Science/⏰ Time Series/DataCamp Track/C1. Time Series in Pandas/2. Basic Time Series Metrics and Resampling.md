# Basic Time Series Metrics and Resampling

## Compare time series growth rates

### Comparing stock performance
- Sock price series: Hard to compare at different levels
- Simple solution -> *Normalize respect to the initial price*:
	- **Normalize** price series to start at the same value:
		- Divide all prices by first in series, multiply by 100
		- Same starting point
		- As a result => ==All prices are relative to the starting point==
		- Then multiply the normalized change by 100
	
```python
first_price = google.price.iloc[0] # Select the initial price
# Now divide all values by the initial one
normalized  = google.price.div(first_price)
# Compute the percentage multiplying by 100
normalized = normalized.mul(100)
# Plit
normalized.plot(title = 'Google Normalized Series')
```
