# Comparing to Human-level performance
***
#AvoidableBias #BayesError #NaturalPerceptionTask


## Why human-level performance?

- Natural to compare against human performance.
	- Because humans are quite good at a lot of tasks.
		- Get label data from humans
		- Gain insight from anual error analysis => *Why didd a person get this right?* => #Explainability
		- Better analysis of #bias / #variance
- ==**Bayes optimal error**== ==> #BayesError:
	- The best possible performance metric:
	- That gives the *best possible* error
		- It is that point where the *true* mapping between $X$ and $y$ can't do it better:
		- $f(X) = y + \epsilon$
	- Some times <span style='color: #FF896F'>Bayes Error is **not** zero</span>

- Commonly is fast to surpass the Human level performance, but it becomes slower to reach the #BayesError 

##### Human-level error as a proxy for Bayer error
- Human-level error cannot be better than #BayesError 
- But for some tasks human-level error approaches Bayes Error


## Avoidable Bias

- *How well does the ML model have to perform on the __training set__?* => The human performance is a good indicator â¤³ Assuming => Bayes error
	- If the model is ==very  poor== compared with the human performance ->
		- ðŸŸ¢  We can focus on reducing the <mark style='background-color: #9CE684 !important'>**bias**</mark>
			- <span style='color: #9CE684'>Avoidable bias</span>
	- If the model is slightly poor than the human level performance ->
		- ðŸ”´  We can focus on reducing the <mark style='background-color: #FFA793 !important'>**variance**</mark>
			- <span style='color: #FF896F'>Just variance</span>

## Surpassing human-level performance
- **What is the avoidable bias?**
	- Depends on the Bayes Error
	- But it is hard to know which is this value

##### Problems where ML significantly surpasses human-level performance
Computers tent to be better with **Structured data** -> ==Not Natural perception tasks==:
- Online advertising
- Making product recommendations
- Logistics (predicting transit time)
- Loan approvals

But there are some Natural perception tasks where computers can be better:
- Speech recognition
- Some image recognition tasks

## Improving your Model performance

### The two fundamental assumptions of  Supervised Learning
#Assumptions #SupervisedLearning
1. <span style='color: cyan'>You can fit the training set pretty well</span>
	- => *Low avoidable bias*
2. <span style='color: cyan'>The trainig set performance generalizes pretty well to the `dev`/`test` set</span>
	- => *The variance is not too high*
