# Backpropagation in CNN

- The backward pass for convolutional networks is complicated.

### Convolutional Layer Backward Pass
#### Computing dA:
- Computes $dA$ with respect to the cost for a certain filter $W_c$ and a given training example $i$:
	$$dA \pm \sum_{h=0}^{n_H}\sum_{w=0}^{n_W} W_c \times dZ_{hw}$$
