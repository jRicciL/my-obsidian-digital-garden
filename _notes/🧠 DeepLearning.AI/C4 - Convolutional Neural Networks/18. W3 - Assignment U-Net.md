# Image Segmentation with U-Net

#ImageSegmentation => [[Image_Processing_in_python#Superpixels and Segmentation]]




***
U-Net, a type of CNN designed for quick, precise image segmentation, and using it to predict a label for every single pixel in an image - in this case, an image from a self-driving car dataset. 

This type of image classification is called ==semantic image segmentation==. 
- It's similar to object detection in that both ask the question: *"What objects are in this image and where in the image are those objects located?,"* 
	- but where object detection labels objects with bounding boxes that may include pixels that aren't part of the object 
- semantic image segmentation allows you to predict a precise mask for each object in the image by labeling each pixel in the image with its corresponding class. The word “semantic” here refers to what's being shown, so for example the “Car” class is indicated below by the dark blue mask, and "Person" is indicated with a red mask:

As you might imagine, region-specific labeling is a pretty crucial consideration for self-driving cars, which require a pixel-perfect understanding of their environment so they can change lanes and avoid other cars, or any number of traffic obstacles that can put peoples' lives in danger. 

By the time you finish this notebook, you'll be able to: 

* Build your own U-Net
* Explain the difference between a regular CNN and a U-net
* Implement semantic image segmentation on the ==#CARLA self-driving car dataset==
* Apply **sparse categorical crossentropy** for pixelwise prediction

Onward, to this grand and glorious quest!

## 2 - Load and Split the Data


```python
import os
import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

import imageio

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline

path = ''
image_path = os.path.join(path, './data/CameraRGB/')
mask_path = os.path.join(path, './data/CameraMask/')
image_list = os.listdir(image_path)
mask_list = os.listdir(mask_path)
image_list = [image_path+i for i in image_list]
mask_list = [mask_path+i for i in mask_list]
```

### Check out the some of the unmasked and masked images from the dataset:

After you are done exploring, revert back to `N=2`. Otherwise the autograder will throw a `list index out of range` error.

```python
N = 2
img = imageio.imread(image_list[N])
mask = imageio.imread(mask_list[N])
#mask = np.array([max(mask[i, j]) for i in range(mask.shape[0]) for j in range(mask.shape[1])]).reshape(img.shape[0], img.shape[1])

fig, arr = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(14, 10))
arr[0].imshow(img)
arr[0].set_title('Image')
arr[1].imshow(mask[:, :, 0])
arr[1].set_title('Segmentation')
```

### 2.1 - Split Your Dataset into Unmasked and Masked Images


```python
image_list_ds = tf.data.Dataset.list_files(image_list, shuffle=False)
mask_list_ds = tf.data.Dataset.list_files(mask_list, shuffle=False)

for path in zip(image_list_ds.take(3), mask_list_ds.take(3)):
    print(path)
```
```
(<tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=string, numpy=b'./data/CameraRGB/000026.png'>, <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=string, numpy=b'./data/CameraMask/000026.png'>)
(<tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=string, numpy=b'./data/CameraRGB/000027.png'>, <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=string, numpy=b'./data/CameraMask/000027.png'>)
(<tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=string, numpy=b'./data/CameraRGB/000028.png'>, <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=string, numpy=b'./data/CameraMask/000028.png'>)
```

```python
image_filenames = tf.constant(image_list)
masks_filenames = tf.constant(mask_list)

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((image_filenames, masks_filenames))

for image, mask in dataset.take(1):
    print(image)
    print(mask)
```

### 2.2 - Preprocess Your Data

Normally, you normalize your image values by dividing them by `255`. This sets them between `0` and `1`. However, using `tf.image.convert_image_dtype` with `tf.float32` sets them between `0` and `1` for you, so there's no need to further divide them by `255`.


```python
def process_path(image_path, mask_path):
    img = tf.io.read_file(image_path)
    img = tf.image.decode_png(img, channels=3)
    img = tf.image.convert_image_dtype(img, tf.float32)

    mask = tf.io.read_file(mask_path)
    mask = tf.image.decode_png(mask, channels=3)
    mask = tf.math.reduce_max(mask, axis=-1, keepdims=True)
    return img, mask

def preprocess(image, mask):
    input_image = tf.image.resize(image, (96, 128), method='nearest')
    input_mask = tf.image.resize(mask, (96, 128), method='nearest')

    return input_image, input_mask

image_ds = dataset.map(process_path)
processed_image_ds = image_ds.map(preprocess)
```
