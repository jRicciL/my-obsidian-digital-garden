# W1: Exercise

## Convolutional Neural Networks

By the end of this notebook, you'll be able to: 

* Explain the convolution operation
* Apply two different types of pooling operation
* Identify the components used in a convolutional neural network (padding, stride, filter, ...) and their purpose
* Build a convolutional neural network 

**Notation**:
- Superscript $[l]$ denotes an object of the $l^{th}$ layer. 
    - Example: $a^{[4]}$ is the $4^{th}$ layer activation. $W^{[5]}$ and $b^{[5]}$ are the $5^{th}$ layer parameters.


- Superscript $(i)$ denotes an object from the $i^{th}$ example. 
    - Example: $x^{(i)}$ is the $i^{th}$ training example input.
    
    
- Subscript $i$ denotes the $i^{th}$ entry of a vector.
    - Example: $a^{[l]}_i$ denotes the $i^{th}$ entry of the activations in layer $l$, assuming this is a fully connected (FC) layer.
    
    
- $n_H$, $n_W$ and $n_C$ denote respectively the height, width and number of channels of a given layer. If you want to reference a specific layer $l$, you can also write $n_H^{[l]}$, $n_W^{[l]}$, $n_C^{[l]}$. 
- $n_{H_{prev}}$, $n_{W_{prev}}$ and $n_{C_{prev}}$ denote respectively the height, width and number of channels of the previous layer. If referencing a specific layer $l$, this could also be denoted $n_H^{[l-1]}$, $n_W^{[l-1]}$, $n_C^{[l-1]}$. 

## Outline of the Assignment

You will be implementing the building blocks of a convolutional neural network! Each function you will implement will have detailed instructions to walk you through the steps:

- Convolution functions, including:
    - Zero Padding
    - Convolve window 
    - Convolution forward
    - Convolution backward (optional)
- Pooling functions, including:
    - Pooling forward
    - Create mask 
    - Distribute value
    - Pooling backward (optional)
    
This notebook will ask you to implement these functions from scratch in `numpy`. In the next notebook, you will use the TensorFlow equivalents of these functions to build the following model:

**Note**: For every forward function, there is a corresponding backward equivalent. Hence, at every step of your forward module you will store some parameters in a cache. These parameters are used to compute gradients during backpropagation.
