# 1x1 Convolutions

## Networks in Networks

Also knows as ==Network in Network==
- It operates over the channels
	- This convolution could reduce (collapse) the number of channels operating independently over each pixel per channel
		- Without considering its local neighbors 
	- ![[Captura de Pantalla 2021-11-21 a la(s) 19.23.37.png]]


- Its the equivalent of having a fully connected network that operates over the same pixel position across different channels
	- It collapses all input pixel channels to one pixel.

> A 1x1 convolution simply maps an input pixel with all it's channels to an output pixel, not looking at anything around itself. It is often used to reduce the number of depth channels, since it is often very slow to multiply volumes with extremely large depths.

```
input (256 depth) -> 1x1 convolution (64 depth) -> 4x4 convolution (256 depth)

input (256 depth) -> 4x4 convolution (256 depth)
```

- Theoretically the neural network can 'choose' which input 'colors' to look at using this, instead of brute force multiplying everything.
