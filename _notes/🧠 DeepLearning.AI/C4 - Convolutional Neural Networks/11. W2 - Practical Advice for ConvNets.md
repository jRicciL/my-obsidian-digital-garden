# Practival Advice for using ConvNets

## Using open-source implementation
- Use github

## Transfer Learning
- Use a pretrained network for a new problem
	- You can download open source *weights* of a pretrained network
- Freeze the pretrained weights of the convolution layers
	- Use the pretrained convolutions for ==feature extraction==
- You can also train over the last few convolution layers
	- This will depend on the data size for retrain for the specific problem
- Train only the classification layers
- Thus, you will be training a shallow network for classification
- You can also use a very small learning rate if you have enough data
	- This way you are using the pretrained weights as the initialization for your network

## Data Augmentation

### Augmentation methods
- Mirroring
- Random cropping
- Rotation
- Shearing
- Local warping
- Color shifting
	- PCA color augmentation
