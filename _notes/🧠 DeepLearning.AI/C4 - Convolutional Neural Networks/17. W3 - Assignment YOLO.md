# Assignment -> YOLO
## Car detection with #YOLO^[[[15. W3 - YOLO algorithm]]]
- you'll implement object detection on a car dataset using the very powerful YOLO model.

#### Highlights
**What you should remember**:
    
- YOLO is a state-of-the-art object detection model that is fast and accurate
- It runs an input image through a CNN, which outputs a 19x19x5x85 dimensional volume. 
- The encoding can be seen as a grid where each of the 19x19 cells contains information about 5 boxes.
- You filter through all the boxes using non-max suppression. Specifically: 
    - Score thresholding on the probability of detecting a class to keep only accurate (high probability) boxes
    - Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholding to eliminate overlapping boxes
- Because training a YOLO model from randomly initialized weights is non-trivial and requires a large dataset as well as lot of computation, previously trained model parameters were used in this exercise. If you wish, you can also try fine-tuning the YOLO model with your own dataset, though this would be a fairly non-trivial exercise. 

#### Goals
- Detected objects in a car detection dataset
- Implemented non-max suppression to achieve better accuracy
- Implemented intersection over union as a function of NMS
- Created usable bounding box tensors from the model's predictions

Amazing work! If you'd like to know more about the origins of these ideas, spend some time on the papers referenced below.

## Problem statement
You are working on a self-driving car. Go you! As a critical component of this project, you'd like to first build a car detection system. To collect data, you've mounted a camera to the hood (meaning the front) of the car, which takes pictures of the road ahead every few seconds as you drive around.

You've gathered all these images into a folder and labelled them by drawing bounding boxes around every car you found. Here's an example of what your bounding boxes look like:

![[Pasted image 20211213115754.png]]

If there are 80 classes you want the object detector to recognize, you can represent the class label 𝑐c either as an integer from 1 to 80, or as an 80-dimensional vector (with 80 numbers) one component of which is 1, and the rest of which are 0. The video lectures used the latter representation; in this notebook, you'll use both representations, depending on which is more convenient for a particular step.
->  About $c$ = can be a single number from 1 to 80, or a vector #One-hot-encoding 


### Model details

#### Inputs and outputs
- The **input** is a batch of images, and each image has the shape ``(m, 608, 608, 3)``
- The **output** is a list of bounding boxes along with the recognized classes. 
- Each bounding box is represented by 6 numbers $(p_c, b_x, b_y, b_h, b_w, c)$ as explained above. If you expand $c$ into an 80-dimensional vector, each bounding box is then represented by 85 numbers. 

#### Anchor Boxes
* Anchor boxes are chosen by exploring the training data to choose reasonable height/width ratios that represent the different classes.  For this assignment, 5 anchor boxes were chosen for you (to cover the 80 classes), and stored in the file './model_data/yolo_anchors.txt'
* The dimension for anchor boxes is the second to last dimension in the encoding: $(m, n_H,n_W,anchors,classes)$.
* The YOLO architecture is: 

$$ IMAGE (m, 608, 608, 3) -> DEEP-CNN -> ENCODING (m, 19, 19, 5, 85).  $$



#### Encoding
Let's look in greater detail at what this encoding represents. 

![[Pasted image 20211213122418.png]]

==NOTE==: If the center/midpoint of an object falls into a grid cell, that grid cell is responsible for detecting that object.

Since you're using 5 ==anchor boxes==, each of the 19 x19 cells thus encodes information about 5 boxes. 
- Anchor boxes are defined only by their width and height.
- For simplicity, you'll flatten the last two dimensions of the shape `(19, 19, 5, 85)` encoding, so the output of the Deep CNN is `(19, 19, 425)`.

![[Pasted image 20211213122840.png]]


#### Class score
Now, for each box (of each cell) you'll compute the following element-wise product and extract a probability that the box contains a certain class.  
The class score is $score_{c,i} = p_{c} \times c_{i}$: the probability that there is an object $p_{c}$ times the probability that the object is a certain class $c_{i}$.


![[Pasted image 20211213124350.png]]

#### Visualizing classes

Here's one way to visualize what YOLO is predicting on an image:

- For each of the 19x19 grid cells, find the maximum of the probability scores (taking a max across the 80 classes, one maximum for each of the 5 anchor boxes).
- Color that grid cell according to what object that grid cell considers the most likely.

Doing this results in this picture: 

![[Pasted image 20211213124509.png]]

<mark style='background-color: #FFA793 !important'>Note:</mark>  this visualization isn't a core part of the YOLO algorithm itself for making predictions; it's just a nice way of visualizing an intermediate result of the algorithm. 

#### Visualizing bounding boxes
Another way to visualize YOLO's output is to plot the bounding boxes that it outputs. Doing that results in a visualization like this.

![[Pasted image 20211213124744.png]]

#### Non-max suppression
We eill use non-max suppression to reduce the number of predicted boxes by employing the following steps:
- Get rid of boxes with a low score. Meaning, the box is not very confident about detecting a class, either due to the low probability of any object, or low probability of this particular class.
- Select only one box when several boxes overlap with each other and detect the same object.


# Exercises

### 2.2 - Filtering with a Threshold on Class Scores

You're going to first apply a filter by thresholding, meaning you'll get rid of any box for which the class "score" is less than a chosen threshold. 

The model gives you a total of 19x19x5x85 numbers, with each box described by 85 numbers. It's convenient to rearrange the (19,19,5,85) (or (19,19,425)) dimensional tensor into the following variables:  
- `box_confidence`: tensor of shape $(19, 19, 5, 1)$ containing $p_c$ (confidence probability that there's some object) for each of the 5 boxes predicted in each of the 19x19 cells.
- `boxes`: tensor of shape $(19, 19, 5, 4)$ containing the midpoint and dimensions $(b_x, b_y, b_h, b_w)$ for each of the 5 boxes in each cell.
- `box_class_probs`: tensor of shape $(19, 19, 5, 80)$ containing the "class probabilities" $(c_1, c_2, ... c_{80})$ for each of the 80 classes for each of the 5 boxes per cell.

## Ex 1 `yolo_filter_boxes`

Implement `yolo_filter_boxes()`.
1. Compute box scores by doing the elementwise product as described in Figure 4 ($p \times c$).  
The following code may help you choose the right operator: 
```python
a = np.random.randn(19, 19, 5, 1)
b = np.random.randn(19, 19, 5, 80)
c = a * b # shape of c will be (19, 19, 5, 80)
```
This is an example of **broadcasting** (multiplying vectors of different sizes).

2. For each box, find:
    - the index of the class with the maximum box score
    - the corresponding box score
    
    **Useful References**
        * [tf.math.argmax](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/math/argmax)
        * [tf.math.reduce_max](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/math/reduce_max)

    **Helpful Hints**
        * For the `axis` parameter of `argmax` and `reduce_max`, if you want to select the **last** axis, one way to do so is to set `axis=-1`.  This is similar to Python array indexing, where you can select the last position of an array using `arrayname[-1]`.
        * Applying `reduce_max` normally collapses the axis for which the maximum is applied.  `keepdims=False` is the default option, and allows that dimension to be removed.  You don't need to keep the last dimension after applying the maximum here.

## 2.3 Non-max Suppression

![[14. W3 - Detection Algorithms#Intersection Over Union]]

Implement `iou()` 

Some hints:
- This code uses the convention that (0,0) is the top-left corner of an image, (1,0) is the upper-right corner, and (1,1) is the lower-right corner. In other words, the (0,0) origin starts at the top left corner of the image. As x increases, you move to the right.  As y increases, you move down.
- For this exercise, a box is defined using its two corners: upper left $(x_1, y_1)$ and lower right $(x_2,y_2)$, instead of using the midpoint, height and width. This makes it a bit easier to calculate the intersection.
- To calculate the area of a rectangle, multiply its height $(y_2 - y_1)$ by its width $(x_2 - x_1)$. Since $(x_1,y_1)$ is the top left and $x_2,y_2$ are the bottom right, these differences should be non-negative.
- To find the **intersection** of the two boxes $(xi_{1}, yi_{1}, xi_{2}, yi_{2})$: 
    - Feel free to draw some examples on paper to clarify this conceptually.
    - The top left corner of the intersection $(xi_{1}, yi_{1})$ is found by comparing the top left corners $(x_1, y_1)$ of the two boxes and finding a vertex that has an x-coordinate that is closer to the right, and y-coordinate that is closer to the bottom.
    - The bottom right corner of the intersection $(xi_{2}, yi_{2})$ is found by comparing the bottom right corners $(x_2,y_2)$ of the two boxes and finding a vertex whose x-coordinate is closer to the left, and the y-coordinate that is closer to the top.
    - The two boxes **may have no intersection**.  You can detect this if the intersection coordinates you calculate end up being the top right and/or bottom left corners of an intersection box.  Another way to think of this is if you calculate the height $(y_2 - y_1)$ or width $(x_2 - x_1)$ and find that at least one of these lengths is negative, then there is no intersection (intersection area is zero).  
    - The two boxes may intersect at the **edges or vertices**, in which case the intersection area is still zero.  This happens when either the height or width (or both) of the calculated intersection is zero.

```python
# BEGIN UNIT TEST
## Test case 1: boxes intersect
box1 = (2, 1, 4, 3)
box2 = (1, 2, 3, 4)

print("iou for intersecting boxes = " + str(iou(box1, box2)))
assert iou(box1, box2) < 1, "The intersection area must be always smaller or equal than the union area."
assert np.isclose(iou(box1, box2), 0.14285714), "Wrong value. Check your implementation. Problem with intersecting boxes"

## Test case 2: boxes do not intersect
box1 = (1,2,3,4)
box2 = (5,6,7,8)
print("iou for non-intersecting boxes = " + str(iou(box1,box2)))
assert iou(box1, box2) == 0, "Intersection must be 0"

## Test case 3: boxes intersect at vertices only
box1 = (1,1,2,2)
box2 = (2,2,3,3)
print("iou for boxes that only touch at vertices = " + str(iou(box1,box2)))
assert iou(box1, box2) == 0, "Intersection at vertices must be 0"

## Test case 4: boxes intersect at edge only
box1 = (1,1,3,3)
box2 = (2,3,3,4)
print("iou for boxes that only touch at edges = " + str(iou(box1,box2)))
assert iou(box1, box2) == 0, "Intersection at edges must be 0"

print("\033[92m All tests passed!")
# END UNIT TEST

### 2.4 - YOLO Non-max Suppression

You are now ready to implement non-max suppression. The key steps are: 
1. Select the box that has the highest score.
2. Compute the overlap of this box with all other boxes, and remove boxes that overlap significantly (iou >= `iou_threshold`).
3. Go back to step 1 and iterate until there are no more boxes with a lower score than the currently selected box.

This will remove all boxes that have a large overlap with the selected boxes. Only the "best" boxes remain.

<a name='ex-3'></a>
### Exercise 3 - yolo_non_max_suppression

Implement `yolo_non_max_suppression()` using TensorFlow. TensorFlow has two built-in functions that are used to implement non-max suppression (so you don't actually need to use your `iou()` implementation):

**Reference documentation**: 

- [tf.image.non_max_suppression()](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/image/non_max_suppression)
```python
tf.image.non_max_suppression(
    boxes,
    scores,
    max_output_size,
    iou_threshold=0.5,
    name=None
)
```
Note that in the version of TensorFlow used here, there is no parameter `score_threshold` (it's shown in the documentation for the latest version) so trying to set this value will result in an error message: *got an unexpected keyword argument `score_threshold`.*

- [tf.gather()](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/gather)
```python
keras.gather(
    reference,
    indices
)
```

##### Code
```python
# UNQ_C3 (UNIQUE CELL IDENTIFIER, DO NOT EDIT)

    classes = tf.gather(classes, nms_indices)
    ### END CODE HERE

    
    return scores, boxes, classes
```

### Exercise 4 - yolo_eval

Implement `yolo_eval()` which takes the output of the YOLO encoding and filters the boxes using score threshold and NMS. There's just one last implementational detail you have to know. 
==NOTE==
There're a few ways of representing boxes, such as via their corners or via their midpoint and height/width. YOLO converts between a few such formats at different times, using the following functions (which are provided): 

```python
boxes = yolo_boxes_to_corners(box_xy, box_wh) 
```
which converts the yolo box coordinates (x,y,w,h) to box corners' coordinates (x1, y1, x2, y2) to fit the input of `yolo_filter_boxes`
```python
boxes = scale_boxes(boxes, image_shape)
```
YOLO's network was trained to run on 608x608 images. If you are testing this data on a different size image -- for example, the car detection dataset had 720x1280 images -- this step rescales the boxes so that they can be plotted on top of the original 720x1280 image.  

Don't worry about these two functions; you'll see where they need to be called below.  

```python
def yolo_boxes_to_corners(box_xy, box_wh):
    """Convert YOLO box predictions to bounding box corners."""
    box_mins = box_xy - (box_wh / 2.)
    box_maxes = box_xy + (box_wh / 2.)

    return tf.keras.backend.concatenate([
        box_mins[..., 1:2],  # y_min
        box_mins[..., 0:1],  # x_min
        box_maxes[..., 1:2],  # y_max
        box_maxes[..., 0:1]  # x_max
    ])
```

### 3.1 - Defining Classes, Anchors and Image Shape

You're trying to detect 80 classes, and are using 5 anchor boxes. The information on the 80 classes and 5 boxes is gathered in two files: "coco_classes.txt" and "yolo_anchors.txt". You'll read class names and anchors from text files. The car detection dataset has 720x1280 images, which are pre-processed into 608x608 images.

```python
class_names = read_classes("model_data/coco_classes.txt")
anchors = read_anchors("model_data/yolo_anchors.txt")
model_image_size = (608, 608) # Same as yolo_model input layer size
```

### 3.2 - Loading a Pre-trained Model

Training a YOLO model takes a very long time and requires a fairly large dataset of labelled bounding boxes for a large range of target classes. You are going to load an existing pre-trained Keras YOLO model stored in "yolo.h5". These weights come from the official YOLO website, and were converted using a function written by Allan Zelener. References are at the end of this notebook. Technically, these are the parameters from the "YOLOv2" model, but are simply referred to as "YOLO" in this notebook.

Run the cell below to load the model from this file.

<a name='3-3'></a>
### 3.3 - Convert Output of the Model to Usable Bounding Box Tensors

The output of `yolo_model` is a (m, 19, 19, 5, 85) tensor that needs to pass through non-trivial processing and conversion. You will need to call `yolo_head` to format the encoding of the model you got from `yolo_model` into something decipherable:

- `yolo_model_outputs = yolo_model(image_data) `

- `yolo_outputs = yolo_head(yolo_model_outputs, anchors, len(class_names))`

The variable `yolo_outputs` will be defined as a set of 4 tensors that you can then use as input by your yolo_eval function. If you are curious about how yolo_head is implemented, you can find the function definition in the file `keras_yolo.py`. The file is also located in your workspace in this path: `yad2k/models/keras_yolo.py`.

<a name='3-4'></a>
### 3.4 - Filtering Boxes

`yolo_outputs` gave you all the predicted boxes of `yolo_model` in the correct format. To perform filtering and select only the best boxes, you will call `yolo_eval`, which you had previously implemented, to do so:

```python
out_scores, out_boxes, out_classes = yolo_eval(
	yolo_outputs, [image.size[1],  
				   image.size[0]], 
	10, 0.3, 0.5)
```
