# RNN step by step

#### Goals
- Define notation for building sequence models.
- Describe the architecture of a basic #RNN 
- Identify the main components of an #LSTM 
- Implement backpropagation through time for a basic RNN and LSTM
- Give examples of several types of RNN

### About RNN^[[[2. W1 - Recurrent Neural Network]]]
- RNN are very effective for Natural Language Processing [[introduction_to_natural_lenguage_processing]] -> Because they have *memory*.
- They can read inputs $x^t$, one by time, and remember some contextual information through the hidden layer activations that get passed from one time step to the next

### Notation
- Superscript $[l]$ denotes an object associated with the $l^{th}$ layer. 
- Superscript $(i)$ denotes an object associated with the $i^{th}$ example. 
- Superscript $\langle t \rangle$ denotes an object at the $t^{th}$ time 
step. 
- Subscript $i$ denotes the $i^{th}$ entry of a vector.

**Example**:  
- $a^{(2)[3]<4>}_5$ denotes the activation of the 2nd training example (2), 3rd layer [3], 4th time step <4>, and 5th entry in the vector.

## Packages
```python
import numpy as np
from rnn_utils import *
from publick_test import **
```

# Forward Propagation for the Basic RNN

- The #RNN will be of the type $T_x = T_y$

#### Dimensions of input $x$
**Input with $n_x$ number of units
- For a single time step of a single input example, $x^{(i)<t>}$ is a one-dimensional input vector
- Using a language. as an example, a languge with 5000-word vocabulary could be #One-hot-encoding into a vector that has 5000 units.
	- So $x^{(i)<t>} \in R^{5000\times 1}$
- The notation $n_x$ is used here to denote the number of units in a single time step of a single training example


#### Time steps of size $T_{x}$
* A recurrent neural network has multiple time steps, which you'll index with $t$.
* In the lessons, you saw *a single training example* $x^{(i)}$ consisting of multiple time steps $T_x$. In this notebook, $T_{x}$ will denote the number of timesteps in the *longest sequence*.

#### Batches of size $m$
* Let's say we have mini-batches, each with 20 training examples  
* To benefit from vectorization, you'll stack 20 columns of $x^{(i)}$ examples
* For example, this tensor has the shape (5000,20,10) 
* You'll use $m$ to denote the number of training examples  
* So, the shape of a mini-batch is $(n_x,m,T_x)$

#### 3D Tensor of shape $(n_{x},m,T_{x})$
* The 3-dimensional tensor $x$ of shape $(n_x,m,T_x)$ represents the input $x$ that is fed into the RNN

#### Taking a 2D slice for each time step: $x^{\langle t \rangle}$
* At each time step, you'll use a mini-batch of training examples (not just a single example)
* So, for each time step $t$, you'll use a 2D slice of shape $(n_x,m)$
* This 2D slice is referred to as $x^{\langle t \rangle}$.  The variable name in the code is `xt`.

### Definition of hidden state $a$

* The activation $a^{\langle t \rangle}$ that is passed to the RNN from one time step to another is called a "hidden state."

### Dimensions of hidden state $a$

* Similar to the input tensor $x$, the hidden state for a single training example is a vector of length $n_{a}$
* If you include a mini-batch of $m$ training examples, the shape of a mini-batch is $(n_{a},m)$
* When you include the time step dimension, the shape of the hidden state is $(n_{a}, m, T_x)$
* You'll loop through the time steps with index $t$, and work with a 2D slice of the 3D tensor  
* This 2D slice is referred to as $a^{\langle t \rangle}$
* In the code, the variable names used are either `a_prev` or `a_next`, depending on the function being implemented
* The shape of this 2D slice is $(n_{a}, m)$

### Dimensions of prediction $\hat{y}$
* Similar to the inputs and hidden states, $\hat{y}$ is a 3D tensor of shape $(n_{y}, m, T_{y})$
    * $n_{y}$: number of units in the vector representing the prediction
    * $m$: number of examples in a mini-batch
    * $T_{y}$: number of time steps in the prediction
* For a single time step $t$, a 2D slice $\hat{y}^{\langle t \rangle}$ has shape $(n_{y}, m)$
* In the code, the variable names are:
    - `y_pred`: $\hat{y}$ 
    - `yt_pred`: $\hat{y}^{\langle t \rangle}$

## How implement an RNN
1. Implement the calculations needed for one time step of the RNN
2. Implement a loop over $T_x$ time steps in order to process all the inputs, one at a time.

## RNN Cell
- RNN is a repeated use of a single cell.
- First we will implement the computations for a single time step.
- The following figure describes the operations for a single time step of an #RNN cell:

![[Pasted image 20211228202612.png]]


==RNN cell==
* Note that an RNN cell outputs the hidden state $a^{\langle t \rangle}$.  
    * `RNN cell` is shown in the figure as the inner box with solid lines  
==RNN cell forward==
* The function that you'll implement, `rnn_cell_forward`, also calculates the prediction $\hat{y}^{\langle t \rangle}$
    * `RNN_cell_forward` is shown in the figure as the outer box with dashed lines


## Exercise 1. `rnn_cell_forward`

Implement the RNN cell described in Figure 2.

**Instructions**:
1. Compute the hidden state with tanh activation: $a^{\langle t \rangle} = \tanh(W_{aa} a^{\langle t-1 \rangle} + W_{ax} x^{\langle t \rangle} + b_a)$
2. Using your new hidden state $a^{\langle t \rangle}$, compute the prediction $\hat{y}^{\langle t \rangle} = softmax(W_{ya} a^{\langle t \rangle} + b_y)$. (The function `softmax` is provided)
3. Store $(a^{\langle t \rangle}, a^{\langle t-1 \rangle}, x^{\langle t \rangle}, parameters)$ in a `cache`
4. Return $a^{\langle t \rangle}$ , $\hat{y}^{\langle t \rangle}$ and `cache`

#### Additional Hints
* A little more information on [numpy.tanh](https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.tanh.html)
* In this assignment, there's an existing `softmax` function for you to use.  It's located in the file 'rnn_utils.py' and has already been imported.
* For matrix multiplication, use [numpy.dot](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.dot.html)

### 1.2 - RNN Forward Pass 

- A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a repetition of the RNN cell that you've just built. 
    - If your input sequence of data is 10 time steps long, then you will re-use the RNN cell 10 times 
- Each cell takes two inputs at each time step:
    - $a^{\langle t-1 \rangle}$: The hidden state from the previous cell
    - $x^{\langle t \rangle}$: The current time step's input data
- It has two outputs at each time step:
    - A hidden state ($a^{\langle t \rangle}$)
    - A prediction ($y^{\langle t \rangle}$)
- The weights and biases $(W_{aa}, b_{a}, W_{ax}, b_{x})$ are re-used each time step 
    - They are maintained between calls to `rnn_cell_forward` in the 'parameters' dictionary

![[Pasted image 20211228204057.png]]

<b>Figure 3</b>: Basic RNN. The input sequence $x = (x^{\langle 1 \rangle}, x^{\langle 2 \rangle}, ..., x^{\langle T_x \rangle})$  is carried over $T_x$ time steps. The network outputs $y = (y^{\langle 1 \rangle}, y^{\langle 2 \rangle}, ..., y^{\langle T_x \rangle})$

### Exercise 2 - `rnn_forward`

Implement the forward propagation of the RNN described in Figure 3.

**Instructions**:
* Create a 3D array of zeros, $a$ of shape $(n_{a}, m, T_{x})$ that will store all the hidden states computed by the RNN
* Create a 3D array of zeros, $\hat{y}$, of shape $(n_{y}, m, T_{x})$ that will store the predictions  
    - Note that in this case, $T_{y} = T_{x}$ (the prediction and input have the same number of time steps)
* Initialize the 2D hidden state `a_next` by setting it equal to the initial hidden state, $a_{0}$
* At each time step $t$:
    - Get $x^{\langle t \rangle}$, which is a 2D slice of $x$ for a single time step $t$
        - $x^{\langle t \rangle}$ has shape $(n_{x}, m)$
        - $x$ has shape $(n_{x}, m, T_{x})$
    - Update the 2D hidden state $a^{\langle t \rangle}$ (variable name `a_next`), the prediction $\hat{y}^{\langle t \rangle}$ and the cache by running `rnn_cell_forward`
        - $a^{\langle t \rangle}$ has shape $(n_{a}, m)$
    - Store the 2D hidden state in the 3D tensor $a$, at the $t^{th}$ position
        - $a$ has shape $(n_{a}, m, T_{x})$
    - Store the 2D $\hat{y}^{\langle t \rangle}$ prediction (variable name `yt_pred`) in the 3D tensor $\hat{y}_{pred}$ at the $t^{th}$ position
        - $\hat{y}^{\langle t \rangle}$ has shape $(n_{y}, m)$
        - $\hat{y}$ has shape $(n_{y}, m, T_x)$
    - Append the cache to the list of caches
* Return the 3D tensor $a$ and $\hat{y}$, as well as the list of caches

#### Additional Hints
- Some helpful documentation on [np.zeros](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.zeros.html)
- If you have a 3 dimensional numpy array and are indexing by its third dimension, you can use array slicing like this: `var_name[:,:,i]`

#### Situations when this RNN will perform better:
- This will work well enough for some applications, but it suffers from vanishing gradients. 
- The RNN works best when each output $\hat{y}^{\langle t \rangle}$ can be estimated using "local" context.  
- "Local" context refers to information that is close to the prediction's time step $t$.
- More formally, local context refers to inputs $x^{\langle t' \rangle}$ and predictions $\hat{y}^{\langle t \rangle}$ where $t'$ is close to $t$.

<font color='orange'><b>What you should remember:</b>
* The recurrent neural network, or RNN, is essentially the repeated use of a single cell.
* A basic RNN reads inputs one at a time, and remembers information through the hidden layer activations (hidden states) that are passed from one time step to the next.
    * The time step dimension determines how many times to re-use the RNN cell
* Each cell takes two inputs at each time step:
    * The hidden state from the previous cell
    * The current time step's input data
* Each cell has two outputs at each time step:
    * A hidden state 
    * A prediction
