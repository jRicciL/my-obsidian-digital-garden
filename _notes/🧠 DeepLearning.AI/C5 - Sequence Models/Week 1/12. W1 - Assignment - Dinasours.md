# Character level text generation RNN

![[Pasted image 20211228220846.png]]

## Assignment

Luckily you're equipped with some deep learning now, and you will use it to save the day! Your assistant has collected a list of all the dinosaur names they could find, and compiled them into this [dataset](dinos.txt). (Feel free to take a look by clicking the previous link.) To create new dinosaur names, you will build a character-level language model to generate new names. Your algorithm will learn the different name patterns, and randomly generate new names. Hopefully this algorithm will keep you and your team safe from the dinosaurs' wrath! 

By the time you complete this assignment, you'll be able to:

* Store text data for processing using an RNN 
* Build a character-level text generation model using an RNN
* Sample novel sequences in an RNN
* Explain the vanishing/exploding gradient problem in RNNs
* Apply gradient clipping as a solution for exploding gradients

Begin by loading in some functions that are provided for you in `rnn_utils`. Specifically, you have access to functions such as `rnn_forward` and `rnn_backward` which are equivalent to those you've implemented in the previous assignment. 

## Packages

```python
import numpy as np
from utils import *
import random
import pprint
import copy
```

## 1 - Problem Statement

<a name='1-1'></a>
### 1.1 - Dataset and Preprocessing

Run the following cell to read the dataset of dinosaur names, create a list of unique characters (such as a-z), and compute the dataset and vocabulary size. 

```python
data = open('dinos.txt', 'r').read()
data= data.lower()
chars = list(set(data))
data_size, vocab_size = len(data), len(chars)
print('There are %d total characters and %d unique characters in your data.' % (data_size, vocab_size))
```

* The characters are a-z (==26 characters==) plus the "`\n`" (or newline character).
* In this assignment, the newline character "`\n`" plays a role similar to the `<EOS>` (or "End of sentence") token discussed in lecture.  
    - Here, "`\n`" indicates the end of the dinosaur name rather than the end of a sentence. 
* `char_to_ix`: In the cell below, you'll create a Python dictionary (i.e., a hash table) to map each character to an index from 0-26.
* `ix_to_char`: Then, you'll create a second Python dictionary that maps each index back to the corresponding character. 
    -  This will help you figure out which index corresponds to which character in the probability distribution output of the softmax layer. 

```python
chars = sorted(chars)
print(chars)

char_to_ix = { ch:i for i,ch in enumerate(chars) }
ix_to_char = { i:ch for i,ch in enumerate(chars) }
pp = pprint.PrettyPrinter(indent=4)
pp.pprint(ix_to_char)
```

### 1.2 - Overview of the Model

Your model will have the following structure: 

- Initialize parameters 
- Run the optimization loop
    - Forward propagation to compute the loss function
    - Backward propagation to compute the gradients with respect to the loss function
    - Clip the gradients to avoid exploding gradients
    - Using the gradients, update your parameters with the gradient descent update rule.
- Return the learned parameters 

![[Pasted image 20211228221514.png]]
<b>Figure 1</b>: *Recurrent Neural Network, similar to what you built in the previous notebook "Building a Recurrent Neural Network - Step by Step."*

* At each time-step, the RNN tries to predict what the next character is, given the previous characters. 
* $\mathbf{X} = (x^{\langle 1 \rangle}, x^{\langle 2 \rangle}, ..., x^{\langle T_x \rangle})$ is a list of characters from the training set.
* $\mathbf{Y} = (y^{\langle 1 \rangle}, y^{\langle 2 \rangle}, ..., y^{\langle T_x \rangle})$ is the same list of characters but shifted one character forward. 
* At every time-step $t$, $y^{\langle t \rangle} = x^{\langle t+1 \rangle}$.  The prediction at time $t$ is the same as the input at time $t + 1$.

## 2 - Building Blocks of the Model

In this part, you will build two important blocks of the overall model:

1. **Gradient clipping:** to avoid exploding gradients
2. **Sampling:** a technique used to generate characters

You will then apply these two functions to build the model.

### 2.1 - Clipping the Gradients in the Optimization Loop

In this section you will implement the `clip` function that you will call inside of your optimization loop. 

#### Exploding gradients
* When gradients are very large, they're called "exploding gradients."  
* Exploding gradients make the training process more difficult, because the updates may be so large that they "overshoot" the optimal values during back propagation.

Recall that your overall loop structure usually consists of:
* forward pass, 
* cost computation, 
* backward pass, 
* parameter update. 

Before updating the parameters, you will perform gradient clipping to make sure that your gradients are not "exploding."

#### Gradient clipping
In the exercise below, you will implement a function `clip` that takes in a dictionary of gradients and returns a clipped version of gradients, if needed. 

* There are different ways to clip gradients.
* You will use a simple element-wise clipping procedure, in which every element of the gradient vector is clipped to fall between some range [-N, N]. 
* For example, if the N=10
    - The range is [-10, 10]
    - If any component of the gradient vector is greater than 10, it is set to 10.
    - If any component of the gradient vector is less than -10, it is set to -10. 
    - If any components are between -10 and 10, they keep their original values

### Exercise 1 - clip
    
Return the clipped gradients of your dictionary `gradients`. 
    
* Your function takes in a maximum threshold and returns the clipped versions of the gradients. 
* You can check out [numpy.clip](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.clip.html) for more info. 
    - You will need to use the argument "`out = ...`".
    - Using the "`out`" parameter allows you to update a variable "in-place".
    - If you don't use "`out`" argument, the clipped variable is stored in the variable "gradient" but does not update the gradient variables `dWax`, `dWaa`, `dWya`, `db`, `dby`.

```python
# UNQ_C1 (UNIQUE CELL IDENTIFIER, DO NOT EDIT)
### GRADED FUNCTION: clip

def clip(gradients, maxValue):
    '''
    Clips the gradients' values between minimum and maximum.
    
    Arguments:
    gradients -- a dictionary containing the gradients "dWaa", "dWax", "dWya", "db", "dby"
    maxValue -- everything above this number is set to this number, and everything less than -maxValue is set to -maxValue
    
    Returns: 
    gradients -- a dictionary with the clipped gradients.
    '''
    gradients = copy.deepcopy(gradients)
    
    dWaa, dWax, dWya, db, dby = gradients['dWaa'], gradients['dWax'], \
                                gradients['dWya'], gradients['db'], gradients['dby']
   
    ### START CODE HERE ###
    # Clip to mitigate exploding gradients, loop over [dWax, dWaa, dWya, db, dby]. (â‰ˆ2 lines)
    for gradient in (dWaa, dWax, dWya, db, dby):
        np.clip(gradient, - maxValue, maxValue, out = gradient)
    ### END CODE HERE ###
    
    gradients = {"dWaa": dWaa, "dWax": dWax, "dWya": dWya, "db": db, "dby": dby}
    
    return gradients
```

## Sampling text with RNN
Now, assume that your model is trained, and you would like to generate new text (characters). The process of generation is explained in the picture below:

![[Pasted image 20211228224009.png]]

In this picture, you can assume the model is already trained. You pass in $x^{\langle 1\rangle} = \vec{0}$ at the first time-step, and have the network sample one character at a time.

<a name='ex-2'></a>
### Exercise 2 - sample

Implement the `sample` function below to sample characters. 

You need to carry out 4 steps:

- **Step 1**: Input the "dummy" vector of zeros $x^{\langle 1 \rangle} = \vec{0}$. 
    - This is the default input before you've generated any characters. 
    You also set $a^{\langle 0 \rangle} = \vec{0}$

- **Step 2**: Run one step of forward propagation to get $a^{\langle 1 \rangle}$ and $\hat{y}^{\langle 1 \rangle}$. Here are the equations:

*hidden state:*  
$$ a^{\langle t+1 \rangle} = \tanh(W_{ax}  x^{\langle t+1 \rangle } + W_{aa} a^{\langle t \rangle } + b)\tag{1}$$

*activation:*
$$ z^{\langle t + 1 \rangle } = W_{ya}  a^{\langle t + 1 \rangle } + b_y \tag{2}$$

*prediction:*
$$ \hat{y}^{\langle t+1 \rangle } = softmax(z^{\langle t + 1 \rangle })\tag{3}$$

- Details about $\hat{y}^{\langle t+1 \rangle }$:
   - Note that $\hat{y}^{\langle t+1 \rangle }$ is a (softmax) probability vector (its entries are between 0 and 1 and sum to 1). 
   - $\hat{y}^{\langle t+1 \rangle}_i$ represents the probability that the character indexed by "i" is the next character.  
   - A `softmax()` function is provided for you to use.

- **Step 3**: Sampling: 
    - Now that you have $y^{\langle t+1 \rangle}$, you want to select the next letter in the dinosaur name. If you select the most probable, the model will always generate the same result given a starting letter. To make the results more interesting, use `np.random.choice` to select a next letter that is *likely*, but not always the same.
    - Pick the next character's **index** according to the probability distribution specified by $\hat{y}^{\langle t+1 \rangle }$. 
    - This means that if $\hat{y}^{\langle t+1 \rangle }_i = 0.16$, you will pick the index "i" with 16% probability. 
    - Use [np.random.choice](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.random.choice.html).

    Example of how to use `np.random.choice()`:
    ```python
    np.random.seed(0)
    probs = np.array([0.1, 0.0, 0.7, 0.2])
    idx = np.random.choice(range(len(probs), p = probs))
    ```
    
    - This means that you will pick the index (`idx`) according to the distribution: 

    $P(index = 0) = 0.1, P(index = 1) = 0.0, P(index = 2) = 0.7, P(index = 3) = 0.2$.

    - Note that the value that's set to `p` should be set to a 1D vector.
    - Also notice that $\hat{y}^{\langle t+1 \rangle}$, which is `y` in the code, is a 2D array.
    - Also notice, while in your implementation, the first argument to `np.random.choice` is just an ordered list [0,1,.., vocab_len-1], it is *not* appropriate to use `char_to_ix.values()`. The *order* of values returned by a Python dictionary `.values()` call will be the same order as they are added to the dictionary. The grader may have a different order when it runs your routine than when you run it in your notebook.

- **Step 4**: Update to $x^{\langle t \rangle }$ 
    - The last step to implement in `sample()` is to update the variable `x`, which currently stores $x^{\langle t \rangle }$, with the value of $x^{\langle t + 1 \rangle }$. 
    - You will represent $x^{\langle t + 1 \rangle }$ by creating a one-hot vector corresponding to the character that you have chosen as your prediction. 
    - You will then forward propagate $x^{\langle t + 1 \rangle }$ in Step 1 and keep repeating the process until you get a `"\n"` character, indicating that you have reached the end of the dinosaur name.

## 3 - Building the Language Model 

It's time to build the character-level language model for text generation! 


<a name='3-1'></a>
### 3.1 - Gradient Descent 

In this section you will implement a function performing one step of stochastic gradient descent (with clipped gradients). You'll go through the training examples one at a time, so the optimization algorithm will be stochastic gradient descent. 

As a reminder, here are the steps of a common optimization loop for an RNN:

- Forward propagate through the RNN to compute the loss
- Backward propagate through time to compute the gradients of the loss with respect to the parameters
- Clip the gradients
- Update the parameters using gradient descent 

Implement the optimization process (one step of stochastic gradient descent).

The following functions are provided:

```python
def rnn_forward(X, Y, a_prev, parameters):
    """ Performs the forward propagation through the RNN and computes the cross-entropy loss.
    It returns the loss' value as well as a "cache" storing values to be used in backpropagation."""
    ....
    return loss, cache
    
def rnn_backward(X, Y, parameters, cache):
    """ Performs the backward propagation through time to compute the gradients of the loss with respect
    to the parameters. It returns also all the hidden states."""
    ...
    return gradients, a

def update_parameters(parameters, gradients, learning_rate):
    """ Updates parameters using the Gradient Descent Update Rule."""
    ...
    return parameters
```

Recall that you previously implemented the `clip` function:
##### Parameters

* Note that the weights and biases inside the `parameters` dictionary are being updated by the optimization, even though `parameters` is not one of the returned values of the `optimize` function. The `parameters` dictionary is passed by reference into the function, so changes to this dictionary are making changes to the `parameters` dictionary even when accessed outside of the function.
* Python dictionaries and lists are "pass by reference", which means that if you pass a dictionary into a function and modify the dictionary within the function, this changes that same dictionary (it's not a copy of the dictionary).

```python
# UNQ_C3 (UNIQUE CELL IDENTIFIER, DO NOT EDIT)
# GRADED FUNCTION: optimize

def optimize(X, Y, a_prev, parameters, learning_rate = 0.01):
    """
    Execute one step of the optimization to train the model.
    
    Arguments:
    X -- list of integers, where each integer is a number that maps to a character in the vocabulary.
    Y -- list of integers, exactly the same as X but shifted one index to the left.
    a_prev -- previous hidden state.
    parameters -- python dictionary containing:
                        Wax -- Weight matrix multiplying the input, numpy array of shape (n_a, n_x)
                        Waa -- Weight matrix multiplying the hidden state, numpy array of shape (n_a, n_a)

                        by -- Bias relating the hidden-state to the output, numpy array of shape (n_y, 1)
    learning_rate -- learning rate for the model.
    
    Returns:
    loss -- value of the loss function (cross-entropy)
    gradients -- python dictionary containing:
                        dWax -- Gradients of input-to-hidden weights, of shape (n_a, n_x)

## Training the model
- Given the dataset of dinosaur names, you'll use each line of the dataset (one name) as one training example.
- Every 2000 steps of stochastic gradient descent, you'll sample several randomly chosen names to see how the algorithm is doing

### Exercise 4 - model

Implement `model()`. 

When `examples[index]` contains one dinosaur name (string), to create an example (X, Y), you can use this:

##### Set the index `idx` into the list of examples

* Using the for-loop, walk through the shuffled list of dinosaur names in the list "`examples`."
	- For example, if there are `n_e` examples, and the for-loop increments the index to `n_e` onwards, think of how you would make the index cycle back to `0`, so that you can continue feeding the examples into the model when `j` is `n_e`, `n_e + 1`, etc.
* Hint: (n_e + 1) % n_e equals 1, which is otherwise the 'remainder' you get when you divide (n_e + 1) by n_e.
* `%` is the [modulo operator in python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-python-modulo-operator-what-does-the-symbol-mean-in-python-solved/).

##### Extract a single example from the list of examples
* `single_example`: use the `idx` index that you set previously to get one word from the list of examples.

##### Convert a string into a list of characters: `single_example_chars`
* `single_example_chars`: A string is a list of characters.
* You can use a list comprehension (recommended over for-loops) to generate a list of characters.
```Python
str = 'I love learning'
list_of_chars = [c for c in str]
print(list_of_chars)
```

```
['I', ' ', 'l', 'o', 'v', 'e', ' ', 'l', 'e', 'a', 'r', 'n', 'i', 'n', 'g']
```

* For more on [list comprehensions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions):

##### Convert list of characters to a list of integers: `single_example_ix`
* Create a list that contains the index numbers associated with each character.
* Use the dictionary `char_to_ix`
* You can combine this with the list comprehension that is used to get a list of characters from a string.

##### Create the list of input characters: `X`
* `rnn_forward` uses the **`None`** value as a flag to set the input vector as a zero-vector.
* Prepend the list [**`None`**] in front of the list of input characters.
* There is more than one way to prepend a value to a list.  One way is to add two lists together: `['a'] + ['b']`

##### Get the integer representation of the newline character `ix_newline`
* `ix_newline`: The newline character signals the end of the dinosaur name.
    - Get the integer representation of the newline character `'\n'`.
    - Use `char_to_ix`

##### Set the list of labels (integer representation of the characters): `Y`
* The goal is to train the RNN to predict the next letter in the name, so the labels are the list of characters that are one time-step ahead of the characters in the input `X`.
    - For example, `Y[0]` contains the same value as `X[1]`  
* The RNN should predict a newline at the last letter, so add `ix_newline` to the end of the labels. 
    - Append the integer representation of the newline character to the end of `Y`.
    - Note that `append` is an in-place operation.
    - It might be easier for you to add two lists together.

## 4 - Conclusion

You can see that your algorithm has started to generate plausible dinosaur names towards the end of training. At first, it was generating random characters, but towards the end you could begin to see dinosaur names with cool endings. Feel free to run the algorithm even longer and play with hyperparameters to see if you can get even better results! Our implementation generated some really cool names like `maconucon`, `marloralus` and `macingsersaurus`. Your model hopefully also learned that dinosaur names tend to end in `saurus`, `don`, `aura`, `tor`, etc.

If your model generates some non-cool names, don't blame the model entirely -- not all actual dinosaur names sound cool. (For example, `dromaeosauroides` is an actual dinosaur name and is in the training set.) But this model should give you a set of candidates from which you can pick the coolest! 

This assignment used a relatively small dataset, so that you're able to train an RNN quickly on a CPU. Training a model of the English language requires a much bigger dataset, and usually much more computation, and could run for many hours on GPUs. We ran our dinosaur name for quite some time, and so far our favorite name is the great, the fierce, the undefeated: **Mangosaurus**!
