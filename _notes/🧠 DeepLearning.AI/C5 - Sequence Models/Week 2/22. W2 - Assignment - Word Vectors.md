# Operations on word vectors

#Assignment #word-embedding #GenderBias
***

- Because word embeddings are very computationally expensive to train, most ML practitioners load a pre-trained set of embeddings.
- In this notebook we'll:
	- ==Load== pre-training embeddings.
	- ==Measure similarity== between embeddings.
	- ==Modify== pre-trained embeddings. 

### Goals
* Explain how word embeddings capture relationships between words
* ==Load== pre-trained word vectors
* ==Measure similarity== between word vectors using cosine similarity
* Use word embeddings to solve ==word analogy== problems such as Man is to `Woman` as `King` is to ______.  

### Highlights
- **Cosine similarity** is a good way to ==compare the similarity between pairs of word vectors==.
    - Note that L2 (Euclidean) distance also works.
- For NLP applications, using a pre-trained set of word vectors is often a great way to get started.

## Packages
```python
import numpy as np
from w2v_utils import *
```

## 1 - Load the Word Vectors
- We will use a 50-dimensional #GloVe vectors to represent words.
- Load `word_to_vec_map`

```python
words, word_to_vec_map = read_glove_vecs('data/glove.6B.50d.txt')
```

We have loaded:
- `words`: set of words in the vocabulary.
- `word_to_vec_map`: dictionary mapping words to their GloVe vector representation.


## 2 - Embedding Vectors Versus One-Hot Vectors
- <mark style='background-color: #FFA793 !important'>Recall</mark> that one-hot vectors don't do a good job of capturing the level of similarity between words. 
	- This is because every one-hot vector *has the same Euclidean distance from any other one-hot vector*.

- ==Embedding vectors==, such as GloVe vectors, **provide much more useful information about the meaning of individual words**.  
- Now, let's see how to use GloVe vectors to measure the similarity between two words!

## 3 - Cosine Similarity

To **measure the similarity between two words**, we need a way to measure the degree of similarity between two embedding vectors for the two words. 
- Given two vectors $u$ and $v$, cosine similarity is defined as follows: 

$$\text{CosineSimilarity(u, v)} = \frac {u \cdot v} {||u||_2 ||v||_2} = cos(\theta)$$

* $u \cdot v$ is the dot product (or inner product) of two vectors
* $||u||_2$ is the norm (or length) of the vector $u$
* $\theta$ is the angle between $u$ and $v$. 
* The cosine similarity depends on the angle between $u$ and $v$. 
    * If $u$ and $v$ are ==very similar==, their ==cosine similarity will be close to 1==.
    * If they are dissimilar, the cosine similarity will take a smaller value. 


### Exercise 1 - cosine_similarity

Implement the function `cosine_similarity()` to evaluate the similarity between word vectors.

**Reminder**: The norm of $u$ is defined as $||u||_2 = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} u_i^2}$

#### Additional Hints
* You may find [np.dot](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.dot.html), [np.sum](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.sum.html), or [np.sqrt](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.sqrt.html) useful depending upon the implementation that you choose.

```python
def cosine_similarity(u, v):
    """
    Cosine similarity reflects the degree of similarity between u and v
        
    Arguments:
        u -- a word vector of shape (n,)          
        v -- a word vector of shape (n,)

    Returns:
        cosine_similarity -- the cosine similarity between u and v defined by the formula above.
    """
    
    # Special case. Consider the case u = [0, 0], v=[0, 0]
    if np.all(u == v):
        return 1
    
    ### START CODE HERE ###
    # Compute the dot product between u and v (≈1 line)
    dot = u.T.dot(v) 
    # Compute the L2 norm of u (≈1 line)
    norm_u = np.linalg.norm(u)
    
    # Compute the L2 norm of v (≈1 line)
    norm_v = np.linalg.norm(v)
    
    # Avoid division by 0
    if np.isclose(norm_u * norm_v, 0, atol=1e-32):
        return 0
    
    # Compute the cosine similarity defined by formula (1) (≈1 line)
    cosine_similarity = dot / (norm_u * norm_v)
    ### END CODE HERE ###
    
    return cosine_similarity
```


## 4 - Word Analogy Task

* In the word analogy task, complete this sentence:  
    <font color='brown'>"*a* is to *b* as *c* is to **____**"</font>. 

* An example is:  
    <font color='brown'> '*man* is to *woman* as *king* is to *queen*' </font>. 

* You're trying to find a word *d*, such that the associated word vectors $e_a, e_b, e_c, e_d$ are related in the following manner:   
    $e_b - e_a \approx e_d - e_c$
* Measure the similarity between $e_b - e_a$ and $e_d - e_c$ using cosine similarity. 

### Exercise 2 - complete_analogy

Complete the code below to perform word analogies!

```python
# UNQ_C2 (UNIQUE CELL IDENTIFIER, DO NOT EDIT)
# GRADED FUNCTION: complete_analogy

def complete_analogy(word_a, word_b, word_c, word_to_vec_map):
    """
    Performs the word analogy task as explained above: a is to b as c is to ____. 
    
    Arguments:
    word_a -- a word, string
    word_b -- a word, string
    word_c -- a word, string
    word_to_vec_map -- dictionary that maps words to their corresponding vectors. 
    
    Returns:
    best_word --  the word such that v_b - v_a is close to v_best_word - v_c, as measured by cosine similarity
    """
    
    # convert words to lowercase
    word_a, word_b, word_c = word_a.lower(), word_b.lower(), word_c.lower()
    
    ### START CODE HERE ###
    # Get the word embeddings e_a, e_b and e_c (≈1-3 lines)
    e_a, e_b, e_c = [word_to_vec_map[w] 
					 for w in [word_a, word_b, word_c]]
	
    ### END CODE HERE ###
    
    words = word_to_vec_map.keys()
    max_cosine_sim = -100              # Initialize max_cosine_sim to a large negative number
    best_word = None                   # Initialize best_word with None, it will help keep track of the word to output
    
    # loop over the whole word vector set
    for w in words:   
        # to avoid best_word being one the input words, skip the input word_c
        # skip word_c from query
        if w == word_c:
            continue
        
        ### START CODE HERE ###
        # Compute cosine similarity between the vector (e_b - e_a) and the vector ((w's vector representation) - e_c)  (≈1 line)
        cosine_sim = cosine_similarity(e_b - e_a, 
									   word_to_vec_map[w] - e_c)
        
        # If the cosine_sim is more than the max_cosine_sim seen so far,
            # then: set the new max_cosine_sim to the current cosine_sim and the best_word to the current word (≈3 lines)
        if cosine_sim > max_cosine_sim:
            max_cosine_sim = cosine_sim
            best_word = w
        ### END CODE HERE ###
        
    return best_word
```

Test the function:
```python
triads_to_try = [('italy', 'italian', 'spain'), ('india', 'delhi', 'japan'), ('man', 'woman', 'boy'), ('small', 'smaller', 'large')]
for triad in triads_to_try:
    print ('{} -> {} :: {} -> {}'.format( *triad, complete_analogy(*triad, word_to_vec_map)))

```
```bash
italy -> italian :: spain -> spanish
india -> delhi :: japan -> tokyo
man -> woman :: boy -> girl
small -> smaller :: large -> smaller
```
- Jum, seems that the last did not work well

## Congratulations!

* Measured the similarity between word vectors using cosine similarity
* Used word embeddings to solve word analogy problems such as Man is to Woman as King is to __.
