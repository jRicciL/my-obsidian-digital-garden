# Debiasing Word Embeddings

- In the following exercise, we'll examine gender biases that can be reflected in a word embedding, and explore algorithms for reducing the bias. 
- In addition to learning about the topic of debiasing, this exercise will also help hone your intuition about what word vectors are doing. This section involves a bit of linear algebra, though you can certainly complete it without being an expert! Go ahead and give it a shot. This portion of the notebook is optional and is not graded...so just have fun and explore.  

First, see how the #GloVe word embeddings relate to gender. 
- We'll begin by computing a vector $g = e_{woman}-e_{man}$, where $e_{woman}$ represents the word vector corresponding to the word *woman*, and $e_{man}$ corresponds to the word vector corresponding to the word *man*. The resulting vector $g$ roughly encodes the concept of "gender". 

You might get a more accurate representation if you compute $g_1 = e_{mother}-e_{father}$, $g_2 = e_{girl}-e_{boy}$, etc. and average over them, but just using $e_{woman}-e_{man}$ will give good enough results for now.
