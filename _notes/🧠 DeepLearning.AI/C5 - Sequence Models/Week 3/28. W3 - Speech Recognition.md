# Speech Recognition

Speech recognition problem

$x$ --> $y$
Audio clip --> Transcript

### Sprectrogram
- A common pre-processing is to run the raw audio clip and generate a spectrogram.
	- Where the horizontal axis is time
	- The Vertical axis is frequency 
	- And the intensity of each cell is the amount of energy

## Attention models for speech recognition
### CTC cost for speech recognition
- In end-to-end deep learning systems phonemes representations are not longer required.
	- Hand engineering notations are not required
- In #SpeechRecognition the number of time-steps in the `input` audio is much bigger than the number of words in the `output` text
- To allow the neural network to have the same size of `input`/`output`:

## Trigger Word Detection System
- There is not wide consensus yet on what is the best algorithm for ==Trigger Word Detection==
