# Docker Networks

## Concepts

#### **Expose the port on the machine** => `docker container run -p`

```bash
docker container run -p 80:80 --name $CONTAINER_NAME -d nginx
```


#### Check the port

```bash
docker container port $CONTAINER_NAME
```

```bash
80/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:80
80/tcp -> :::80
```

## Virtual Network

#### Check the port with `inspect --format`^[[[2. First Steps on Containers#To monitor what's happening inside a container]]]
- A more cleaner way including the IP of the host

```bash
docker container inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' $CONTAINER_NAME
```
-> `172.17.0.2` <- Defined by a ==Virtual Network== named **bridge** (*docker0*)

## Defaults
- Each container connected to a private virtual network ==bridge==
- Each virtual network routes through NAT firewall on host IP
- **All containers on a virtual network can talk to each other without `-p`**

#### Cluster the apps to related networks
- ==Best practice== is to create a new virtual network for each app:
	- network `my_web_app` for *mysql* and *php/apache* containers
	- network `my_api` for *mongo* and *nodejs* containers

#### Skip virtual networks and use the host IP

```bash
--net=host
```

## Command Line Management 

### List networks
```bash 
docker network ls
```

```
NETWORK ID     NAME      DRIVER    SCOPE
857ff4780c7c   bridge    bridge    local
a9368cdb6a90   host      host      local
130193d7f863   none      null      local
```

#### The `bridge` network
- ==bridge== (or *docker0*) -> Is the default Docker virtual network, which is a NAT'ed behind the Host IP
- By default all the containers are attached to ==bridge==
	- `172.17.0.X`

#### The `host` network

- It **gains performance** by skipping virtual networks but **sacrifices security** of container model
	- In certain situations could be used

#### The `none` network
- Removes `eth0` and only leaves you with localhost interface in container

### Inspect networks
```bash
docker network inspect bridge
```

```bash
"Containers": {
            "236408b96e46f8fdbe41b8b01f09af4553403d3b0011cee0333015de1bdae912": {
                "Name": "webhost",
                "EndpointID": "bbbea399eaee98e4b74b1425556e5223d4049b165ad9ebc987ffbe0b8758b782",
                "MacAddress": "02:42:ac:11:00:02",
                "IPv4Address": "172.17.0.2/16",
                "IPv6Address": ""
            }
        },
```

### Create networks

- Create a network with the `bridge` **driver**.
```bash
docker network create my_network
```

### Define network at container creation

```bash
docker container run -d --name $CONT_NAME --network $NET_NAME nginx
```

### Connect and disconnect containers to networks

#### Connect
- Connect a `$CONTAINER_ID` to a `$NETWORk_ID`
- The container can be connected to more than one network
```bash
docker network connect $NETWORK_ID $CONTAINER_ID
```

#### Disconnect 

```bash
docker network disconnect $NETWORK_ID $CONTAINER_ID
```

## DNS
### How containers Find each other
- The DNS is the key to easy inter-container commands
	- Docker daemon has a built-in DNS server that containers use by default
- Use ==DNS naming==, not static IPs, to connect containers

> Static IP and using IPs for talking to containers is an **anti-pattern**
	> Avoid it!!

- **Containers shoulnd't relly on IPs for inter-communication**
- Use custom networks

#### DNS default names
- Docker defaults the hostname to the container name ->
	- But aliases are also possible

```bash
docker container run -d --name $NEW_CONT --network $MY_NET nginx
```

## Assignment
### DNS Round Robin Test

==Round Robin== =>
https://www.cloudflare.com/es-es/learning/dns/glossary/round-robin-dns/

#### Goals
- Known how to use `it` to get shell in container
- Understand bascs of what a Linux distribution is like Ubuntu and CentOS
- Know how to run a container 
- Understand basics of #DNSrecords

#### Instructions
- 
- Run `centos curl -s search:9200` with `net` multiple times until you see both "name" fields show

#### Implementation
1. We can have multiple containers on a created network respond to the same DNS address
2. Create new virtual network (default `birdge` driver)
```bash
docker network create my_network_test
docker netwokr ls
```

3. Create two containers from `elasticsearch:2` [image](https://hub.docker.com/_/elasticsearch)
4. Research and use `--network-alias search` when creating them to give them an additional DNS name to respond
```bash
# First container (we don't care abut the names)
docker network create -d --net my_network_test --net-alias search elasticsearch:2
# Second container
docker network create -d --net my_network_test --net-alias search elasticsearch:2
```

5. Run `alpine nslookup searc` with `--net` to see the two containers list the same DNS name
```bash
# Verify the containers are running
docker container ls
```
```bash
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE             COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS          PORTS                NAMES
e99fe515e146   elasticsearch:2   "/docker-entrypoint.…"   4 seconds ago        Up 1 second     9200/tcp, 9300/tcp   nice_cohen
7369a9f6a8ca   elasticsearch:2   "/docker-entrypoint.…"   About a minute ago   Up 57 seconds   9200/tcp, 9300/tcp   silly_fermi
```

- Now we will create a new container from `alpine` to run `nslookup search` and verify that the DNS from the two previous containers are working
	- We will use `-rm` to delete the container after the execution
	- About **NsLookUp** => A tool to test if the DNS are working 
```bash
# Use an extra container form `alpine` image to run `nslookup search`
# We will use `-rm` to delete after the execution
docker container run -rm --net my_network_test alpine nslookup search
```
