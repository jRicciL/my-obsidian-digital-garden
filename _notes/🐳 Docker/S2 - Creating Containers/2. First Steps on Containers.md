# First steps on containers

### Defining the port of the container
```docker
docker container run --publish 8070:80 nginx
```
- The `--publish 8070:80` exposed the port `8070` of the ==host== IP bound to the port `80` of the container
	- The first is the **host**
	- The second is the **container**
- Go to the browser -> `localhost`

### Running in background
- Use the `--detach`

```docker
docker container run --publish 8070:80 --detach nginx
```
This should return a unique ID for the running container:
`6ba8c18f86c58f5fe6718f09c80aec4b5cd745c80060e711aeb8eb99bf9419d4`

### List of **running** containers

```
docker container ls
```
```code
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                                   NAMES
6ba8c18f86c5   nginx     "/docker-entrypoint.â€¦"   16 seconds ago   Up 15 seconds   0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp, :::8080->80/tcp   gracious_mahavira
```

### Stop a running container
```bash
# Use the first digits of the container ID
docker container stop 6ba8c
```

### The `start` command
- `docker container run` ==always== starts a **new** container
- `docker container start` => Starts an stoped container


### List of all containers

```
docker container ls -a
```

### Name a docker container
- If a name is not specified, a name will be randomly generated
- To create a container with a given name:

```
docker container run --publish 8080:80 --detach --name webhost2_braulio nginx
```

### See the `logs` of a running container on background

- See the logs of a background running container

```bash
docker container logs $CONTAINER_NAME
```

### Remove a docker container
- You cannot remove a *running* docker container
- To remove a docker container

```shell
docker container rm $CONTAINER_ID
```

## What happens in `docker container run`?
1. Looks for that image locally in image cache.
	- If does not find it =>
	- Looks in remote image repository => *Docker Hub*
	- Downloads the latest version
2. Creates new container based on that image and prepares to start
- Gives it a virtual IP on a private network inside docker engine
- Opens up port 80 on host and forwards to port 80 in container
- Starts container by using the CMD in the image `Dockerfile`

## Container vs Virtual Machine
![[Captura de Pantalla 2021-12-28 a la(s) 17.03.02.png]]
- **Containers are not mini-VMS** 
- They are just processes
- Limited to what resources they can access
- Exits when process stops

### See the processes running inside the container
```bash
docker top $CONTAINER_NAME
```

- A running container is a process running in the host.

## Assignment: Manage Multiple Containers
1. Run a `nginx` container =>

```bash
docker container run --name nginx -d nginx --publish 8080:80
```

2. Run a `mysql` container on port `3306:3306`
3. use the `--env` option to pass in `MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD`

- Create the container
```bash
docker container run -d -p 3630:3630 --name db -e MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD=yes mysql
```
- Check the logs
```bash
docker container logs db | grep PASS
```



4. Use `docker container logs` on mysql to find the random password it created on startup
5. Clean all the containers with `docker container stop` 
	1. Remove all of them with `docker container rm`
6. Use `docker container ls` to ensure everything is correct before and after cleanup

# What's going on in containers

### To monitor what's happening inside a container:

- **docker container top**
	- process list in one container
- **docker container inspect**
	- details of one container config
	- Information like:
		- Network
		- IP Address
		- Mounts
		- Current status
- **docker container stats $CONTAINER_NAME**
	- performance stats for all containers

## Getting a Shell inside containers

### Create a container and open it in the terminal

- The key is use the command `bash` <- tells docker to run the `bash` program
```bash
docker container run --name ruby2 -it -p 8000:4000 ruby:2.7 bash
```

### Start an existing container with bash open

```bash
docker container start $CONTAINER_NAME -ai
```

### Start a **running** container with bash open
- Use the `exec` command => On an ==existing container==
```python
docker container exec -it $CONTAINER_NAME bash
```

## Alpine linux image
- #Alpine is a very small linux version
- To install it => `docker pull alpine`
- It so small that it does not include `bash`
	- So to start #Alpine, we can use `sh`

```bash
docker container run -it alpine sh
```




# Quizz
1. If you wanted to view running containers as well as containers that you have stopped and not removed, what command would you use?
	- `docker container ls -a`
2. What does the `-d` flag do in a docker run command?
	- It detaches the container to run in the background, and returns you to the shell prompt
3. Would the following two commands create a port conflict error with each other?
```bash
docker container run -p 80:80 -d nginx  
docker container run -p 8080:80 -d nginx
```
- No 

4. I ran '`docker container run -p 80:80 nginx`' and my command line is gone and everything looks frozen. Why?
	- You did not detached the container and there are not any Nginx logs yet
