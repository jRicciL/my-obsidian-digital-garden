# Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks with Keras

#ANN are at the very core of Deep Learning.


## From Biological to Artificial Neurons
- **1943**: The #ANN were first **introduced** by the neurophysiologist Warren McCulloch and the mathematician Walter Pitts:
	- *A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity*
- Early 1980s: New architectures were invented but progress was slow.
	- In 1990s, other #ML architectures were invented like #SVM

#### The actual wave of interest in ANNs:
- There is now a huge quatity of data to train neural networks.
- The tremendous increase in computing power.
	- [[Moore's law]]: The number of components in integrated circuits has doubled about every 2 years over the last 50 years.
	- The gaming industry -> Development of GPU cards
	- Cloud platforms
- Training algorithms have been improved.
- Some theoretical limitations of #ANNs have turned out to be benign in practice.
