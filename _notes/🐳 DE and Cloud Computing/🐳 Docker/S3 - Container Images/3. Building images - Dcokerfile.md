# Building images with `Dockerfile`

## The `Dockerfile` basics:
- `Dockerfile` => A recipe to create a **docker image**
	- Contains the instructions on how to build a docker image

### A `Dockerfile` example
- The default name is `Dockerfile`
	- We can specify a different name using:
	- `docker build -f $file_name`


```bash
# NOTE: this example is taken from the default Dockerfile for the official nginx Docker Hub Repo
# https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/
# NOTE: This file is slightly different than the video, because nginx versions have been updated 
#       to match the latest standards from docker hub... but it's doing the same thing as the video
#       describes
FROM debian:stretch-slim
# all images must have a FROM
# usually from a minimal Linux distribution like debian or (even better) alpine
# if you truly want to start with an empty container, use FROM scratch

ENV NGINX_VERSION 1.13.6-1~stretch
ENV NJS_VERSION   1.13.6.0.1.14-1~stretch
# optional environment variable that's used in later lines and set as envvar when container is running

RUN apt-get update \
	&& apt-get install --no-install-recommends --no-install-suggests -y gnupg1 \
	&& \
	NGINX_GPGKEY=573BFD6B3D8FBC641079A6ABABF5BD827BD9BF62; \
	found=''; \
	for server in \
		ha.pool.sks-keyservers.net \
		hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 \
		hkp://p80.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 \
		pgp.mit.edu \
	; do \
		echo "Fetching GPG key $NGINX_GPGKEY from $server"; \
		apt-key adv --keyserver "$server" --keyserver-options timeout=10 --recv-keys "$NGINX_GPGKEY" && found=yes && break; \
	done; \
	test -z "$found" && echo >&2 "error: failed to fetch GPG key $NGINX_GPGKEY" && exit 1; \
	apt-get remove --purge -y gnupg1 && apt-get -y --purge autoremove && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* \
	&& echo "deb http://nginx.org/packages/mainline/debian/ stretch nginx" >> /etc/apt/sources.list \
	&& apt-get update \
	&& apt-get install --no-install-recommends --no-install-suggests -y \
						nginx=${NGINX_VERSION} \
						nginx-module-xslt=${NGINX_VERSION} \
						nginx-module-geoip=${NGINX_VERSION} \
						nginx-module-image-filter=${NGINX_VERSION} \
						nginx-module-njs=${NJS_VERSION} \
						gettext-base \
	&& rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
# optional commands to run at shell inside container at build time
# this one adds package repo for nginx from nginx.org and installs it

RUN ln -sf /dev/stdout /var/log/nginx/access.log \
	&& ln -sf /dev/stderr /var/log/nginx/error.log
# forward request and error logs to docker log collector

EXPOSE 80 443
# expose these ports on the docker virtual network
# you still need to use -p or -P to open/forward these ports on host

CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
# required: run this command when container is launched
# only one CMD allowed, so if there are multiple, last one wins

```

### `Dockerfile` keywords and commands

The `Dockerfile` commands/keywords are also referred to as ==stanza== ( #stanza ):

- ðŸ”´ `FROM` => 
	- Always required
	- Defines the OS distribution
		- `Debian`, `Ubuntu`, `Fedora`, `CentOS`
- ðŸŸ¢ `ENV` =>
	- **Environment variables**
	- Main way to set `key`/`values` of running containers
	- Declared as `ENV KEY value` and used as `${KEY}`

- `RUN` =>
	- **Execute shell commands** or scripts inside the container as it is built
	- The use of `&&` to chain commands, assures that this executions are done in the same single layer

- `EXPOSE` =>
	- Expose the given ports on the docker virtual network
	- This does not expose the port on the host, that should be done using the `-p` command when running a container.

- `CMD` =>
	- Required parameter
	- Final command that is going to ==be run every time== the container is ==created== or ==restarted==

## Running Docker builds

### Building images

- To create a docker image from a `Dockerfile`:

```bash
docker image build -t customnginx .
```

ðŸ”´ <span style='color: orange; font-weight: bold'>Important!</span>
- **At the top of the `Dockerfile`**:
	- Keep the things that ==change the less==
- **At the bottom of the `Dockerfile`**:
	- Keep the things that ==change the most==

## Extend Official images
- Using an Official image.

A simpler `Dockerfile` file:

```bash
# this shows how we can extend/change an existing official image from Docker Hub

FROM nginx:latest
# highly recommend you always pin versions for anything beyond dev/learn

WORKDIR /usr/share/nginx/html
# change working directory to root of nginx webhost
# using WORKDIR is preferred to using 'RUN cd /some/path'

COPY ./index.html index.html

# I don't have to specify EXPOSE or CMD because they're in my FROM
```

Inside the directory we also have the following `html` file:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">

  <title>Your 2nd Dockerfile worked!</title>

</head>

<body>
  <h1>Hello Obsidian Garden</h1>
  This is a test on building docker images
</body>
</html>
```

#### Used commands
- `WORKDIR`:
	- Change word directory
	- Is preferred to using `RUN cd path`

- `COPY`:
	- Copy a file from host directory to the current path directory inside the image

Now, let's build an image using the above `Dockefile`;
```bash
docker image build -t my-ngnix-with-html .
```
```bash
