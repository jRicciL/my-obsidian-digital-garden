# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning follows an iterative process

graph LR

a[Define<br>the Problem] --> b[Build<br>the Dataset]
b --> c[Train<br>the model]
c --> d[Evaluate<br>the Model]
d --> e[Use<br>the Model]
```

## Model inference
Model inference involves:
- Generating predictions -> ==Supervised==
- Finding patterns in the data -> ==Unsupervised==
- Using a trained model
- Testing the model on data it has not seen before
