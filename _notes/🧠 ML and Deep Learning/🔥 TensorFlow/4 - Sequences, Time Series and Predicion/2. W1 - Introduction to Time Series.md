# Introduction to Time Series

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
```

## Trend and Seasonality
```python
def trend(time, slope = 0):
	return slope * time
```

```python
time = np.arange(4 * 365 + 1)
baseline = 10
series = trend(time, 0.1)

  

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plot_series(time, series)
plt.show(
```

## Create a Artificial TimeSeries

### Trend
```python
def trend(time, slope = 0):
	return slope * time
```

### Seasonality

- Seasonal pattern
```python
def seasonal_pattern(season_time):
	"""Just an arbitrary pattern, you can change it if you wish"""
	return np.where(
		season_time < 0.4,
		np.cos(season_time * 2 * np.pi),
		1 / np.exp(3 * season_time)
	)
```

- Seasonality
```python
def seasonality(time, period, amplitude=1, phase=0):
    """Repeats the same pattern at each period"""
    season_time = ((time + phase) % period) / period
    return amplitude * seasonal_pattern(season_time
```

### Noise

```python
def noise(time, noise_level=1, seed=None):
	rnd = np.random.RandomState(seed)
	return rnd.randn(len(time)) * noise_leve
```
