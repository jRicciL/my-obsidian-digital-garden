# Sequences and Prediction

## Time Series Examples
**Time Series**:
- Defined as an ordered sequence of values that usually equally spaced over time.

**Univariate time series**
- A time series with a single value per time-stamp

**Multivariate time series**
- A time series that has multiple values per each time-step
- Two univariate time series can be combined to a Multivariate time series and *new patters can emerge* from that.

## Machine Learning applied to Time Series
**What can we do with ML over Time Series?**
- Forecasting
	- Predict future values
	- Project back to the **past** => ==imputation==
	- **Fill** holes in the time serie => ==imputation==
- Anomaly detection
- Analyze the time series to spot patterns in it
	- Speech recognition
	- Ripple identification

## Common patterns in time
- Trend
- Seasonality => Repeated patterns
- Trend + Seasonality
- Random values => White noise
	- Show no autocorrelation
- Autocorrelated Time Series
	- Memory and Innovation
	- Measures the linear relationship between *lagged values* of a time series
- Non-stationary time series
	- The current behavior changes due to an unexpected event

==IMPORTANT!== => For time series **more data is not always the best choice**
- Particularly if the time series ins non-stationary

### Autocorrelation in time Series
- Data that follows a predictable shape, even if the scale is different
Autocorrelation formula:
$$r_k = \frac{\sum_{t=k+1}^T (y_t - \bar y)(y_{t-k} - \bar y)}{\sum_{t=1}^T (y_t - \bar y)^2}$$

- The numerator is similar to covariance between the current and lagged versions of the time series.
- The denominator is similar to the square of standard deviation => Variance of the original time series (but lacking the $N-1$)
