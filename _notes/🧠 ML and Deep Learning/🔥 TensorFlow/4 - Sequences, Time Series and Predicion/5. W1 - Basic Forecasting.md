# Basic Forecasting

## Naive Forecasting
- Take the current value and asume that the next time-step will be the same value

## Moving Average
- Compute the average of the values given a time window
- Eliminates a lot of the noise
- Does not anticipate trends or seasonality

## Differencing
- Study the difference between the value at time $t$ minus the value at time $t-k$, where $k$ is a selecte time interval
- It removes the seasonality and trend from the `input` time series

## Moving average on differenced Time Series
- Compute the Moving Average after computing the Differencing

### Restoring the Trend and Seasonality
- Then, reverse the Differencing by adding back the value at time $t-k$ to the current value $t$ 
	- -> *Forecast* = moving average of differenced series + series($t- k$)

### Remove noise by centered moving average of past series
- Smoothing both past and present values
- -> *Forecast* = trailing moving average of differenced series + centered moving average of past series($t-k$)

- **Trailing** moving average is used for present values
	- Because we cannot preform Centered moving average on present windows as we dont know future values
