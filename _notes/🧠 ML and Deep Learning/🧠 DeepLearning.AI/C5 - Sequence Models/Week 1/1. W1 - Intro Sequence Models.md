In some cases both the `input` and the `output` are sequences.
In other cases the only the `input` is a sequence... or only the `output` is a generated sequence.

## Sequence models **NOTATION**

- $x^{(i)}$: `input` sequence, example $i$
- $x^{(i)<t>}$: element $t$ of the `input` sequence $i$
- $y^{(i)}$: The `output` sequence of the $i$ training example 

### Representing words
- ==Vocabulary==: A dictionary with unique words mapped to numbers
	- The vocabulary has a size $S$, which is as long as the number of items
	- It also includes a extra token => `<UNK>`
- Each `input` sequence is represented by #One-hot-encoding
