# Emogify

Welcome to the second assignment of Week 2! You're going to use word vector representations to build an **Emojifier**. 
ü§© üí´ üî•

Have you ever wanted to make your text messages more expressive? Your emojifier app will help you do that. 
Rather than writing:
>"Congratulations on the promotion! Let's get coffee and talk. Love you!"   

The emojifier can automatically turn this into:
>"Congratulations on the promotion! üëç  Let's get coffee and talk. ‚òïÔ∏è Love you! ‚ù§Ô∏è"

You'll implement a model which inputs a sentence (such as "Let's go see the baseball game tonight!") and finds the most appropriate emoji to be used with this sentence (‚öæÔ∏è).

### Using Word Vectors to Improve Emoji Lookups
* In many emoji interfaces, you need to remember that ‚ù§Ô∏è  is the "heart" symbol rather than the "love" symbol. 
    * In other words, you'll have to remember to type "heart" to find the desired emoji, and typing "love" won't bring up that symbol.
* You can make a more flexible emoji interface by using word vectors!
* When using word vectors, you'll see that even if your training set explicitly relates only a few words to a particular emoji, **your algorithm will be able to generalize and associate additional words in the test set to the same emoji.**
    * *This works even if those additional words don't even appear in the training set.* 
    * *This allows you to build an accurate classifier mapping from sentences to emojis, even using a small training set.* 

### What you'll build:
1. In this exercise, you'll start with a ==baseline model== (`Emojifier-V1`) using word embeddings.
2. Then you will build a more sophisticated model (`Emojifier-V2`) that further incorporates an #LSTM. 

## Goals

* Create an embedding layer in Keras with pre-trained word vectors
* Explain the advantages and disadvantages of the GloVe algorithm
* Describe how negative sampling learns word vectors more efficiently than other methods
* Build a sentiment classifier using word embeddings
* Build and train a more sophisticated classifier using an LSTM

## Packages

```python
import numpy as np
from emo_utils import *
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from test_utils import *
```

## Baseline Model: `Emojifier-V1`

### Dataset EMOJISET
Let's start by building a ==simple baseline classifier==. 

You have a tiny dataset (`X`, `Y`) where:
- $X$ contains 127 sentences (strings).
- $Y$ contains an integer label between 0 and 4 corresponding to an `emoji` for each sentence.

![[Pasted image 20220107192919.png]]

Load the dataset using the code below. The dataset is split between training (127 examples) and testing (56 examples).

```python
X_train, Y_train = read_csv('data/train_emoji.csv')
X_test, Y_test = read_csv('data/tesss.csv')
```

```python
maxLen = len(max(X_train, key=len).split())
```

Run the following cell to print sentences from `X_train` and corresponding labels from `Y_train`. 
* Change `idx` to see different examples. 
* Note that due to the font used by iPython notebook, the heart emoji may be colored black rather than red.

```python
for idx in range(10):
    print(X_train[idx], label_to_emoji(Y_train[idx]))
```

```
never talk to me again üòû
I am proud of your achievements üòÑ
It is the worst day in my life üòû
Miss you so much ‚ù§Ô∏è
food is life üç¥
I love you mum ‚ù§Ô∏è
Stop saying bullshit üòû
congratulations on your acceptance üòÑ
The assignment is too long  üòû
I want to go play ‚öæ
```

### 1.2 - Overview of the Emojifier-V1

In this section, you'll implement a baseline model called "`Emojifier-v1`".  

#### Inputs and Outputs
* The `input` of the model is a string corresponding to a sentence (e.g. "I love you"). 
* The `output` will be a probability vector of shape (1,5), (indicating that there are 5 emojis to choose from).
* The (1,5) probability vector is passed to an `argmax` layer, which extracts the index of the emoji with the highest probability.

![[Pasted image 20220107193219.png]]

#### One-hot Encoding
* To get your labels into a format suitable for training a #softmax classifier, convert $Y$ from its current shape  $(m, 1)$ into a "one-hot representation" $(m, 5)$, 
    * Each row is a one-hot vector giving the label of one example.
    * Here, `Y_oh` stands for "Y-one-hot" in the variable names `Y_oh_train` and `Y_oh_test`: 

```python
Y_oh_train = convert_to_one_hot(Y_train, C = 5)
Y_oh_test  = convert_to_one_hot(Y_test, C = 5)
```

Now, see what `convert_to_one_hot()` did. Feel free to change `index` to print out different values. 

```python
idx = 50
print(f"Sentence '{X_train[50]}' has label index {Y_train[idx]}, which is emoji {label_to_emoji(Y_train[idx])}", )
print(f"Label index {Y_train[idx]} in one-hot encoding format is {Y_oh_train[idx]}")
```
```
Sentence 'I missed you' has label index 0, which is emoji ‚ù§Ô∏è
Label index 0 in one-hot encoding format is [1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
```

### 1.3 - Implementing Emojifier-V1

As shown in Figure 2 (above), the first step is to:
* **Convert each word in the `input` sentence into their word vector representations.**
* **Take an average of the word vectors.** 

Similar to this week's previous assignment, you'll use pre-trained 50-dimensional GloVe embeddings. 

Run the following cell to load the `word_to_vec_map`, which contains all the vector representations.

```python
word_to_index, index_to_word, word_to_vec_map = read_glove_vecs('data/glove.6B.50d.txt')
```

You've loaded:
- `word_to_index`: dictionary mapping from words to their indices in the vocabulary 
    - (400,001 words, with the valid indices ranging from 0 to 400,000)
- `index_to_word`: dictionary mapping from indices to their corresponding words in the vocabulary
- `word_to_vec_map`: dictionary mapping words to their #GloVe^[[[18. W2 - GloVe]]] vector representation.

Run the following cell to check if it works:

```python
word = "dog"
idx = 43525
print("the index of", word, "in the vocabulary is", word_to_index[word])
print("the", str(idx) + "th word in the vocabulary is", index_to_word[idx])
```
```python
the index of dog in the vocabulary is 126864
the 43525th word in the vocabulary is aaahh
```

### Exercise 1 - sentence_to_avg

Implement `sentence_to_avg()` 

You'll need to carry out two steps:

1. Convert every sentence to lower-case, then split the sentence into a list of words. 
    * `X.lower()` and `X.split()` might be useful. üòâ
2. For each word in the sentence, access its GloVe representation.
    * Then take the average of all of these word vectors.
    * You might use `numpy.zeros()`, which you can read more about [here]('https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.zeros.html').
    
    
#### Additional Hints
* When creating the `avg` array of zeros, you'll want it to be a vector of the same shape as the other word vectors in the `word_to_vec_map`.  
    * You can choose a word that exists in the `word_to_vec_map` and access its `.shape` field.
    * Be careful not to hard-code the word that you access.  In other words, don't assume that if you see the word 'the' in the `word_to_vec_map` within this notebook, that this word will be in the `word_to_vec_map` when the function is being called by the automatic grader.

**Hint**: you can use any one of the word vectors that you retrieved from the input `sentence` to find the shape of a word vector.

```python
# BEGIN UNIT TEST
avg = sentence_to_avg("Morrocan couscous is my favorite dish", word_to_vec_map)
print("avg = \n", avg)

def sentence_to_avg_test(target):
    # Create a controlled word to vec map
    word_to_vec_map = {'a': [3, 3], 'synonym_of_a': [3, 3], 'a_nw': [2, 4], 'a_s': [3, 2], 
                       'c': [-2, 1], 'c_n': [-2, 2],'c_ne': [-1, 2], 'c_e': [-1, 1], 'c_se': [-1, 0], 
                       'c_s': [-2, 0], 'c_sw': [-3, 0], 'c_w': [-3, 1], 'c_nw': [-3, 2]
                      }
    # Convert lists to np.arrays
    for key in word_to_vec_map.keys():
        word_to_vec_map[key] = np.array(word_to_vec_map[key])
        
    avg = target("a a_nw c_w a_s", word_to_vec_map)
    assert tuple(avg.shape) == tuple(word_to_vec_map['a'].shape),  "Check the shape of your avg array"  
    assert np.allclose(avg, [1.25, 2.5]),  "Check that you are finding the 4 words"
    avg = target("love a a_nw c_w a_s", word_to_vec_map)
    assert np.allclose(avg, [1.25, 2.5]), "Divide by count, not len(words)"
    avg = target("love", word_to_vec_map)
    assert np.allclose(avg, [0, 0]), "Average of no words must give an array of zeros"
    avg = target("c_se foo a a_nw c_w a_s deeplearning c_nw", word_to_vec_map)
    assert np.allclose(avg, [0.1666667, 2.0]), "Debug the last example"
    
    print("\033[92mAll tests passed!")
    
sentence_to_avg_test(sentence_to_avg)

# END UNIT TEST
```

## 1.4 - Implement the model
You know have all the pieces to finish implementing the `model()` function! After using `sentence_to_avg()` we need to:
- Pass the average through forward propagation
- Compute the cost
- Backporpagate to update the #softmax parameters

### Exercise 2 - model
Implement `model()` function described in Figure 2:
- The equations you need to implement in the forward pass and to compute the cross-entropy√ë
- The variable $Y_{oh}$ ("Y one hot") is the one-hot encoding of the output labels. 

$$ z^{(i)} = Wavg^{(i)} + b$$

$$ a^{(i)} = softmax(z^{(i)})$$

$$ \mathcal{L}^{(i)} = - \sum_{k = 0}^{n_y - 1} Y_{oh,k}^{(i)} * log(a^{(i)}_k)$$

**Note**: It is possible to come up with a more efficient vectorized implementation. For now, just use nested for loops to better understand the algorithm, and for easier debugging.

The function `softmax()` is provided, and has already been imported.

    return pred, W, b
```

Run the next cell to train your model and learn the softmax parameters (W, b). **The training process will take about 5 minutes**
```python
np.random.seed(1)
pred, W, b = model(X_train, Y_train, word_to_vec_map)
print(pred)
```
```

Epoch: 100 --- cost = 34.98206370947518
Accuracy: 0.8712121212121212
```

### 1.5 - Examining Test Set Performance 

Note that the `predict` function used here is defined in `emo_util.spy`.

```python
print("Training set:")
pred_train = predict(X_train, Y_train, W, b, word_to_vec_map)
print('Test set:')
pred_test = predict(X_test, Y_test, W, b, word_to_vec_map)
```
```
Training set:
Accuracy: 0.8257575757575758
Test set:
Accuracy: 0.75
```

**Note**:
* Random guessing would have had 20% accuracy, given that there are 5 classes. (1/5 = 20%).
* This is pretty good performance after training on only 127 examples. 


#### The Model Matches Emojis to Relevant Words
In the training set, the algorithm saw the sentence 

>"I love you." 

with the label ‚ù§Ô∏è. 
* You can check that the word "adore" does not appear in the training set. 
* Nonetheless, let's see what happens if you write "I adore you."

```python
X_my_sentences = np.array(["i adore you", "i love you", "funny lol", "lets play with a ball", "food is ready", "not feeling happy"])
Y_my_labels = np.array([[0], [0], [2], [1], [4],[3]])

pred = predict(X_my_sentences, Y_my_labels , W, b, word_to_vec_map)
print_predictions(X_my_sentences, pred)
```

Amazing! 
* Because *adore* has a similar embedding as *love*, the algorithm has generalized correctly even to a word it has never seen before. 
* Words such as *heart*, *dear*, *beloved* or *adore* have embedding vectors similar to *love*. 
    * Feel free to modify the inputs above and try out a variety of input sentences. 
    * How well does it work?

#### Word Ordering isn't Considered in this Model
* Note that the model doesn't get the following sentence correct:
>"not feeling happy" 

* This algorithm ignores word ordering, so is not good at understanding phrases like "not happy." 

#### Confusion Matrix
* Printing the confusion matrix can also help understand which classes are more difficult for your model. 
* A confusion matrix shows how often an example whose label is one class ("actual" class) is mislabeled by the algorithm with a different class ("predicted" class).

Print the confusion matrix below:

```python
# START SKIP FOR GRADING
print(Y_test.shape)
print('           '+ label_to_emoji(0)+ '    ' + label_to_emoji(1) + '    ' +  label_to_emoji(2)+ '    ' + label_to_emoji(3)+'   ' + label_to_emoji(4))
print(pd.crosstab(Y_test, pred_test.reshape(56,), rownames=['Actual'], colnames=['Predicted'], margins=True))
plot_confusion_matrix(Y_test, pred_test)
# END SKIP FOR GRADING
```
```
(56,)
           ‚ù§Ô∏è    ‚öæ    üòÑ    üòû   üç¥
Predicted  0.0  1.0  2.0  3.0  4.0  All
Actual                                 
0            2    0    3    2    0    7
1            0    7    1    0    0    8
2            0    0   18    0    0   18
3            0    1    5   10    0   16
4            0    0    2    0    5    7
All          2    8   29   12    5   56
```
![[Pasted image 20220111214147.png]]

#### What you should remember:
- Even with a mere 127 training examples, you can get a reasonably good model for Emojifying. 
    - This is due to the generalization power word vectors gives you. 
- Emojify-V1 will perform poorly on sentences such as *"This movie is not good and not enjoyable"* 
    - It doesn't understand combinations of words.
    - It just averages all the words' embedding vectors together, without considering the ordering of words. 
    
**Not to worry! You will build a better algorithm in the next section!**

## 2 - Emojifier-V2: Using LSTMs in Keras 

You're going to build an LSTM model that takes word **sequences** as input! This model will be able to account for word ordering. 

Emojifier-V2 will continue to use pre-trained word embeddings to represent words. You'll feed word embeddings into an LSTM, and the LSTM will learn to predict the most appropriate emoji. 

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow
np.random.seed(0)
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Input, Dropout, LSTM, Activation
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import sequence
from tensorflow.initialize import glorot_uniform
np.random.seed(1)
```

## 2.1 - Model Overview

![[Pasted image 20220111214551.png]]

## 2.2 - Keras and Mini-batching
In this exercise, you want to train Keras using mini-batches. However, most deep learning frameworks require that all sequences in the same mini-batch has the **same length**.

This is what allows vextorization to work: 
- If you had a 3-word sentence and a 4-word sentence, then the computations needed for them are different (one takes 4 steps on an LSTM, one takes 4 steps) so it is just not possible to do them both at the same time.

### Padding Handles Sequences of Varying Length
- The common solution to handing sequences of different length is to use padding. Specifically:
	- Set a maximum sequence length
	- Pad all sequences to have the same length

#### Example of padding
- Given a maximum sequence length of 20, you could pad every sentence with 0s so that each input sentence is length 20.
- Thus, the sentence "I love you" would be represented as $(e_{I}, e_{love}, e_{you}, \vec{0}, \vec{0}, \ldots, \vec{0})$. 
* In this example, any sentences longer than 20 words would have to be truncated. 
* One way to choose the maximum sequence length is to just pick the length of the longest sentence in the training set. 

## 2.3 - The Embedding layer
In #Keras, the `Embedding` matrix is represented as a layer.
- The embedding matrix maps word indices to embedding vectors.
	- The word indices are positive integers.
	- The embedding vectors are dense vectors of fixed size.
	- A dense vector is the opposite of a sparse vector. It means that most of its values are non-zero. As a counter-example, a one-hot encoded vector is not dense.
- The embedding matrix can be derived in two ways.
	1. Training a model to derive the embeddings from scratch
	2. Using a pretrained embedding

### Using an Updating pre-trained Embeddings
In this section, you'll create an `Embedding` layer in #Keras.
- You will initialize the Embedding layer with Glove 50-dimensional vectors.
- In the code below, you'll. observe how Keras allows you to either train or leave this layer fixed.
	- Because your training set is quite small, you will leave the GloVe embeddings fixed instead of updating them.

#### Imputs and Outputs to the Embedding Layer
- The `Embedding()` layer's input is an integer matrix of size:
	- batch size
	- max input length
		- This input corresponds to sentences converted into lists of indices (integers)
		- The largest integer (the highest word index) in the input should be no larger than the vocabulary size
	- The embedding layer outputs an array of shape (batch size, max input length, dimension of word vectors)

![[Pasted image 20220111215830.png]]

* The figure shows the propagation of two example sentences through the embedding layer. 
    * Both examples have been zero-padded to a length of `max_len=5`.
    * The word embeddings are 50 units in length.
    * The final dimension of the representation is  `(2,max_len,50)`. 

### Exercise 3 - sentences_to_indices

Implement `sentences_to_indices`

This function processes an array of sentences `X` and returns inputs to the embedding layer:

* Convert each training sentences into a list of indices (the indices correspond to each word in the sentence)
* Zero-pad all these lists so that their length is the length of the longest sentence.
    
#### Additional Hints:
* Note that you may have considered using the `enumerate()` function in the for loop, but for the purposes of passing the autograder, please follow the starter code by initializing and incrementing `j` explicitly.

```python
# UNQ_C3 (UNIQUE CELL IDENTIFIER, DO NOT EDIT)

    X -- array of sentences (strings), of shape (m, 1)

        # Convert the ith training sentence in lower case and split is into words. You should get a list of words.
        sentence_words = X[i].lower().split()
        
        # Initialize j to 0
        j = 0
        
        # Loop over the words of sentence_words

        for w in sentence_words:
            # if w exists in the word_to_index dictionary
            if w in word_to_index:
                # Set the (i,j)th entry of X_indices to the index of the correct word.
                X_indices[i, j] = word_to_index[w]
                # Increment j to j + 1
                j += 1

    return X_indices

print("X1 =", X1)
print("X1_indices =\n", X1_indices)

## Build Embedding Layer

Now you'll build the `Embedding()` layer in Keras, using pre-trained word vectors. 

* The embedding layer takes as input a list of word indices.
    * `sentences_to_indices()` creates these word indices.
* The embedding layer will return the word embeddings for a sentence. 

### Exercise 4 - pretrained_embedding_layer

Implement `pretrained_embedding_layer()` with these steps:

1. Initialize the embedding matrix as a numpy array of zeros.
    * The embedding matrix has a row for each unique word in the vocabulary.
        * There is one additional row to handle "unknown" words.
        * So vocab_size is the number of unique words plus one.
    * Each row will store the vector representation of one word. 
        * For example, one row may be 50 positions long if using GloVe word vectors.
    * In the code below, `emb_dim` represents the length of a word embedding.
2. Fill in each row of the embedding matrix with the vector representation of a word
    * Each word in `word_to_index` is a string.
    * word_to_vec_map is a dictionary where the keys are strings and the values are the word vectors.
3. Define the Keras embedding layer. 
    * Use [Embedding()](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Embedding). 
    * The input dimension is equal to the vocabulary length (number of unique words plus one).
    * The output dimension is equal to the number of positions in a word embedding.
    * Make this layer's embeddings fixed.
        * If you were to set `trainable = True`, then it will allow the optimization algorithm to modify the values of the word embeddings.
        * In this case, you don't want the model to modify the word embeddings.
4. Set the embedding weights to be equal to the embedding matrix.
    * Note that this is part of the code is already completed for you and does not need to be modified!

## 2.4 - Building the Emojifier-V2

![[Pasted image 20220111221716.png]]

### Exercise 5 - Emojify-V2

Implement `Emojify_V2`. 
This function builds a #Keras graph of the architecture shown above.
- The model outputs a softmax probability vector of shape (`m`, `C = 5`)
- We may need to use the following #Keras layers:
	- `Input()`
		- Set the `shspe` and `dtype` parameters.
		- The inputs are integers, so you can specify the data type as a string, `int32`
	- `LSTM()`:
		- Set the `units` and `return_sequences` parameters
	- `Dropout()`:
		- Set the `rate` parameters
	- `Dense()`
		- Set the `units`
		- Note that `Dense()` has an `activation` parameter. For the purposes of passing the autograder, please do not set the activation within `Dense()`. Use the separate `Activation()` layer to do so.
	- `Activation()`
		- You can pass in the activation of you choice as a lower case string.
	- `Model()`
		- Set `inputs` and `outputs`

#### Additional Hints
* Remember that these Keras layers return an object, and you will feed in the outputs of the previous layer as the input arguments to that object.  The returned object can be created and called in the same line.

```Python
# How to use Keras layers in two lines of code
dense_object = Dense(units = ...)
X = dense_object(inputs)

# How to use Keras layers in one line of code
X = Dense(units = ...)(inputs)
```

* The `embedding_layer` that is returned by `pretrained_embedding_layer` is a layer object that can be called as a function, passing in a single argument (sentence indices).

* Here is some sample code in case you're stuck: üòä
```Python
raw_inputs = Input(shape=(maxLen,), dtype='int32')
preprocessed_inputs = ... # some pre-processing
X = LSTM(units = ..., return_sequences= ...)(processed_inputs)
X = Dropout(rate = ..., )(X)
...
X = Dense(units = ...)(X)
X = Activation(...)(X)
model = Model(inputs=..., outputs=...)
...
```

#### Model implementation

Run the following cell to create your model and check its summary. 

* Because all sentences in the dataset are less than 10 words, `max_len = 10` was chosen.  
* You should see that your architecture uses 20,223,927 parameters, of which 20,000,050 (the word embeddings) are non-trainable, with the remaining 223,877 being trainable. 
* Because your vocabulary size has 400,001 words (with valid indices from 0 to 400,000) there are 400,001\*50 = 20,000,050 non-trainable parameters. 

```python

#### Compile the Model 

As usual, after creating your model in Keras, you need to compile it and define what loss, optimizer and metrics you want to use. Compile your model using `categorical_crossentropy` loss, `adam` optimizer and `['accuracy']` metrics:

```python
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

### 2.5 - Train the Model 

It's time to train your model! Your Emojifier-V2 `model` takes as input an array of shape (`m`, `max_len`) and outputs probability vectors of shape (`m`, `number of classes`). Thus, you have to convert X_train (array of sentences as strings) to X_train_indices (array of sentences as list of word indices), and Y_train (labels as indices) to Y_train_oh (labels as one-hot vectors).

```python
X_train_indices = sentences_to_indices(X_train, word_to_index, maxLen)
Y_train_oh = convert_to_one_hot(Y_train, C = 5)
```

Fit the Keras model on `X_train_indices` and `Y_train_oh`, using `epochs = 50` and `batch_size = 32`.

```python
model.fit(X_train_indices, Y_train_oh, epochs = 50, batch_size = 32, shuffle=True)
```

```
Epoch 44/50
5/5 [==============================] - 0s 33ms/step - loss: 0.0314 - accuracy: 0.9924
Epoch 45/50
5/5 [==============================] - 0s 21ms/step - loss: 0.0255 - accuracy: 0.9924
Epoch 46/50
5/5 [==============================] - 0s 33ms/step - loss: 0.0262 - accuracy: 0.9924
Epoch 47/50
```

Your model should perform around **90% to 100% accuracy** on the training set. Exact model accuracy may vary! 

Run the following cell to evaluate your model on the test set: 

```python
X_test_indices = sentences_to_indices(X_test, word_to_index, max_len = maxLen)
Y_test_oh = convert_to_one_hot(Y_test, C = 5)
loss, acc = model.evaluate(X_test_indices, Y_test_oh)
print()
print("Test accuracy = ", acc)
```
```python
2/2 [==============================] - 0s 2ms/step - loss: 0.3710 - accuracy: 0.8571

Test accuracy =  0.8571428656578064
```

```python
# This code allows you to see the mislabelled examples
C = 5
y_test_oh = np.eye(C)[Y_test.reshape(-1)]
X_test_indices = sentences_to_indices(X_test, word_to_index, maxLen)
pred = model.predict(X_test_indices)
for i in range(len(X_test)):
    x = X_test_indices
    num = np.argmax(pred[i])
    if(num != Y_test[i]):
        print('Expected emoji:'+ label_to_emoji(Y_test[i]) + ' prediction: '+ X_test[i] + label_to_emoji(num).strip())
```
```python
Expected emoji:üòÑ prediction: he got a very nice raise	‚ù§Ô∏è
Expected emoji:üòÑ prediction: she got me a nice present	‚ù§Ô∏è
Expected emoji:üòû prediction: work is hard	üòÑ
Expected emoji:üòû prediction: This girl is messing with me	‚ù§Ô∏è
Expected emoji:üòû prediction: work is horrible	üòÑ
Expected emoji:üòÑ prediction: you brighten my day	‚ù§Ô∏è
Expected emoji:üòû prediction: she is a bully	‚ù§Ô∏è
Expected emoji:üòÑ prediction: will you be my valentine	‚ù§Ô∏è
```

Now you can try it on your own example! Write your own sentence below:

```python
# Change the sentence below to see your prediction. Make sure all the words are in the Glove embeddings.  
x_test = np.array(['I cannot play'])
X_test_indices = sentences_to_indices(x_test, word_to_index, maxLen)
print(x_test[0] +' '+  label_to_emoji(np.argmax(model.predict(X_test_indices))))
```

#### LSTM Version Accounts for Word Order
* The Emojify-V1 model did not "not feeling happy" correctly, but your implementation of Emojify-V2 got it right! 
    * If it didn't, be aware that Keras' outputs are slightly random each time, so this is probably why. 
* The current model still isn't very robust at understanding negation (such as "not happy")
    * This is because the training set is small and doesn't have a lot of examples of negation. 
    * If the training set were larger, the LSTM model would be much better than the Emojify-V1 model at understanding more complex sentences. 

### Congratulations!
 
You've completed this notebook, and harnessed the power of LSTMs to make your words more emotive! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

By now, you've: 

* Created an embedding matrix
* Observed how negative sampling learns word vectors more efficiently than other methods
* Experienced the advantages and disadvantages of the GloVe algorithm
* And built a sentiment classifier using word embeddings! 

Cool! (or Emojified: üòéüòéüòé ) 

<font color='blue'><b>What you should remember</b>:
- If you have an NLP task where the training set is small, using word embeddings can help your algorithm significantly. 
- Word embeddings allow your model to work on words in the test set that may not even appear in the training set. 
- Training sequence models in Keras (and in most other deep learning frameworks) requires a few important details:
    - To use mini-batches, the sequences need to be **padded** so that all the examples in a mini-batch have the **same length**. 
    - An `Embedding()` layer can be initialized with pretrained values. 
        - These values can be either fixed or trained further on your dataset. 
        - If however your labeled dataset is small, it's usually not worth trying to train a large pre-trained set of embeddings.   
    - `LSTM()` has a flag called `return_sequences` to decide if you would like to return every hidden states or only the last one. 
    - You can use `Dropout()` right after `LSTM()` to regularize your network.
