# YOLO algorithm
- #YOLO Is a [[14. W3 - Detection Algorithms]]

[[14. W3 - Detection Algorithms#Bounding box predictions]]


***
### Highlights
- Is a popular algorithm because it achieves high accuracy while also being able to run in real time.
- The algorithm "Only Looks Once" at the image in the sense that it requires only one forward propagation pass through the network to make predictions.
	- ==Only one forward propagation to make predictions==
	- After #NonMaxSupression it the n outputs recognized objects together with the bounding boxes
- #YOLOv2 runs an input image through a CNN, which outputs a `19x19x5x85` dimensional value.
***

## Training phase

- It uses Object Localization^[[[14. W3 - Detection Algorithms#Object localization]]]

#### Example
- Three classes: $c_1, c_2, c_3$
- A `3x3` grid
- Two *anchor boxes*^[[[14. W3 - Detection Algorithms#Anchor Boxes]]]
- <mark style='background-color: #FFA793 !important'>Response variable</mark>:
	- $y \in R^{3\times3\times2\times8}$
	-  `y = 3x3x2x8`
		-  `8` comes from = $[p_c, b_x, b_y, b_h, b_w, c_1, c_2, c_3]$
		-  $5$ default values for the surrounding box
		-  $3$ from the three classes

## Making predictions
![[Captura de Pantalla 2021-12-08 a la(s) 20.21.30.png]]

#### Steps 
1. For each grid cell, get $k$ predictied bounding boxes (giving $k$ anchor boxes during the training phase (2 in the example)).

2. Get rid of low probability predictions using a threshold for each $p_c$

3. For each class (pedestrian, car, motorcycle) use *non-max suppression*^[[14. W3 - Detection Algorithms#Non-max Suppression]] to generate the final predictions.
