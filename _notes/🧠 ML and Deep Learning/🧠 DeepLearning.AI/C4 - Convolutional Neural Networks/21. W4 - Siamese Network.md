# Siamese Network
A CNN^[[[1. W1 - CNN]]] used for Face Recognition^[[[19. W4 - Face Recognition]]] to solve the One-Shot Learning^[[[20. W4 - One-shot Learning]]] problem.

- It uses an ==encoding== ($f(x_1)$) of the input image ($x_1$).
	- This encoding layer is used instead of the last output layer used for classificaiton.

- The algorithms uses the function $d(x_1, x_2) = ||f(x_1 - f(x_2)||_2^2$

#### Formally
Learn parameters so that:
- If $x_i$, $x_j$ are the same person, then $d(x_1, x_2) = ||f(x_1) - f(x_2)||_2^2$ is small.

## Triplet Loss function
A *loss function* required to obtain the parameters of the #SiameseNetwork in order to trained it.

### Learning objective
- It uses three images at a time:
	- ==Anchor== image $A$ => The reference image of a given person
	- ==Positive== image $P$ => Another image of the same person but different from the anchor image. It will work as the positive example
	- ==Negative== image $N$ => An image from a different person.

Therefore the encoding is the following:
- $d(A, P) = ||f(A) - f(P)||_2^2$ should be small
	- As both images belong to the same person
- $d(A, N) = ||f(A) - f(N)||_2^2$ should be big, as the images are from different persons.

Which is similar to:
- $||f(A) - f(P)||_2^2  \le f(A) - f(N)||_2^2$

But the actual way to solve this is by:
$||f(A) - f(P)||_2^2   -  ||f(A) - f(N)||_2^2 \le 0 - \alpha$
$$||f(A) - f(P)||_2^2   -  ||f(A) - f(N)||_2^2 + \alpha \le 0$$

- THe $\alpha$ parameter is used to avoid the network solving the problem trivially

The overall cost is:

## Choosing the triplets $A$, $P$, $N$
- During training, if `A`, `P`, `N` are chosen randomly:
	- $d(A,P) + \alpha \leq d(A.N)$ is easily satisfied.
- So it is need to choose triplets that are hard to train on.

## Binary Classification approach
