# Assignment Face Recognition^[[[19. W4 - Face Recognition]]]

#Assignment 
***
### What you should remember
- Face verification solves an easier 1:1 matching problem, face recognition addresses a harder 1:K matching problem.
- Triplet loss is an effective loss function for training a neural network to learn an encoding of a face image.
- The same encoding can be used for verification and recognition.
- Measuring distances between toe images' encodings allows you to determine whether they are pictures of the same person.
***

Welcome! In this assignment, you're going to build a face recognition system. Many of the ideas presented here are from [FaceNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03832.pdf). In the lecture, you also encountered [DeepFace](https://research.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/deepface-closing-the-gap-to-human-level-performance-in-face-verification.pdf).

Face recognition problems commonly fall into one of two categories:

**Face ==Verification==** *"Is this the claimed person?"* For example, at some airports, you can pass through customs by letting a system scan your passport and then verifying that you (the person carrying the passport) are the correct person. A mobile phone that unlocks using your face is also using face verification. This is a 1:1 matching problem.

**Face ==Recognition==** *"Who is this person?"* For example, the video lecture showed a [face recognition video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wr4rx0Spihs) of Baidu employees entering the office without needing to otherwise identify themselves. This is a 1:K matching problem.

[[FaceNet]] learns a neural network that **encodes a face image into a vector of 128 numbers**. By comparing two such vectors, you can then determine if two pictures are of the same person.

By the end of this assignment, you'll be able to: 

* Differentiate between face recognition and face verification
* Implement one-shot learning^[[[20. W4 - One-shot Learning]]] to solve a face recognition problem
* Apply the triplet loss function^[[[21. W4 - Siamese Network#Triplet Loss function]]] to learn a network's parameters in the context of face recognition
* Explain how to pose face recognition as a binary classification problem
* Map face images into `128-dimensional encodings` using a pretrained model
* Perform face ==verification== and face ==recognition== with these encodings

**Channels-last notation**

For this assignment, you'll be using a pre-trained model which represents ConvNet activations using a =="channels last" convention==, as used during the lecture and in previous programming assignments.

In other words, a batch of images will be of shape $(m, n_H, n_W, n_C)$.

## Naive Face Verification
In Face Verification, you are given two images and you have to determine if they are of the same person. 
- The simplest way to do this is to compare the two images pixel-by-pixel. 
- If the distance beween the raw images is below a chosen threshold, it may be the same person.
- Of course, this algorithm performs poorly, since the pixel values change dramatically due to variations in lighting, orientation of the person's face, minor changes in head position, and so on.
- You'll see that rather than using the raw image, you can learn an encoding, $f(img)$.
- By using an encoding for each image, an element-wise comparison produces a more accurate judgement as to whether two pictures are of the same person.

## Encoding Face Images into a 128-Dimensional Vector
### 3.1 - Using a ConvNet to Compute Encodings

The FaceNet model takes a lot of data and a long time to train. So following the common practice in applied deep learning, you'll load weights that someone else has already trained. The network architecture follows the Inception model from [Szegedy *et al*..](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4842) An Inception network implementation has been provided for you, and you can find it in the file `inception_blocks_v2.py` to get a closer look at how it is implemented.  

*Hot tip:* Go to "File->Open..." at the top of this notebook. This opens the file directory that contains the `.py` file).

The key things to be aware of are:

- This network uses `160x160` dimensional RGB images as its input. Specifically, a face image (or batch of $m$ face images) as a tensor of shape $(m, n_H, n_W, n_C) = (m, 160, 160, 3)$
- The input images are originally of shape `96x96`, thus, you need to scale them to `160x160`. This is done in the `img_to_encoding()` function.
- The output is a matrix of shape $(m, 128)$ that encodes each input face image into a 128-dimensional vector

Run the cell below to create the model for face images!

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import model_from_json

json_file = open('keras-facenet-h5/model.json', 'r')
loaded_model_json = json_file.read()
json_file.close()
model = model_from_json(loaded_model_json)
model.load_weights('keras-facenet-h5/model.h5')
```

Summarize the input and output shapes
```python
print(model.inputs)
print(model.outputs)
```
```
[<tf.Tensor 'input_1:0' shape=(None, 160, 160, 3) dtype=float32>]
[<tf.Tensor 'Bottleneck_BatchNorm/batchnorm/add_1:0' shape=(None, 128) dtype=float32>]
```

By using a 128-neuron fully connected layer as its last layer, the model ensures that the output is an encoding vector of size 128.

![[Pasted image 20211220123829.png]]

- An encoding is a good one if:
	- The encodings of two images of the same person are quite similar to each other.
	- The encodings of two images of different persons are very different.
- The tripplet loss function formalizes the above:
	- It tries to push the encodings of two images of the same person closer together, while pulling the encodings of two images from different persons further apart.
	- ![[Pasted image 20211220124022.png]]

### The Triplet Loss implementation
<mark style='background-color: #FFA793 !important'>Important note =></mark> The triplet loss is the main ingredient of hte face recognition algorithm, and you'll need to know how to use it for training your own FaceNet model.

##### Codification
For an image $x$, its encoding is denotes as $f(x)$, where $f$ is the function computed by the neural network.
![[Pasted image 20211220124304.png]]

Triplets of images:
- $A$ is an *Anchor* image => An image of a person
- $P$ is a *Positive* image => A picture of the **same** person
- $N$ is a *Negative* image => An image of a **different** person

Triples are picked from the training dataset => ($A^i, P^i, N^i$) => where $i$ is the $i$-training example.
- <mark style='background-color: #9CE684 !important'>NOTE:</mark> Make sure that the image $A^i$ is closer to $P^i$ than to the Negative image $N^i$ by at least a margin $\alpha$.
$$
|| f\left(A^{(i)}\right)-f\left(P^{(i)}\right)||_{2}^{2}+\alpha<|| f\left(A^{(i)}\right)-f\left(N^{(i)}\right)||_{2}^{2}
$$

The objective is to minimize the #TripletCost:
$$\mathcal{J} = \sum^{m}_{i=1} \large[ \small \underbrace{\mid \mid f(A^{(i)}) - f(P^{(i)}) \mid \mid_2^2}_\text{(1)} - \underbrace{\mid \mid f(A^{(i)}) - f(N^{(i)}) \mid \mid_2^2}_\text{(2)} + \alpha \large ] \small_+ \tag{3}$$
Here, the notation "$[z]_+$" is used to denote $max(z,0)$.

==Notes about the cost function==:
- The term (1) is the squared distance between the anchor "A" and the positive "P" for a given triplet; you want this to be small.
- The term (2) is the squared distance between the anchor "A" and the negative "N" for a given triplet, you want this to be relatively large. It has a minus sign preceding it because minimizing the negative of the term is the same as maximizing that term.
- $\alpha$ is called the margin. It's a hyperparameter that you pick manually. You'll use $\alpha = 0.2$.
- Most implementations also rescale the encoding vectors to haven L2 norm equal to one (i.e., $\mid \mid f(img)\mid \mid_2$=1); you won't have to worry about that in this assignment.

### Exercise 1 - `triplet_loss`

Implement the triplet loss as defined by formula (3). These are the 4 steps:

1. Compute the distance between the encodings of "anchor" and "positive": $\mid \mid f(A^{(i)}) - f(P^{(i)}) \mid \mid_2^2$
2. Compute the distance between the encodings of "anchor" and "negative": $\mid \mid f(A^{(i)}) - f(N^{(i)}) \mid \mid_2^2$
3. Compute the formula per training example: 
	- $\mid \mid f(A^{(i)}) - f(P^{(i)}) \mid \mid_2^2 - \mid \mid f(A^{(i)}) - f(N^{(i)}) \mid \mid_2^2 + \alpha$
4. Compute the full formula by taking the max with zero and summing over the training examples:$$\mathcal{J} = \sum^{m}_{i=1} \large[ \small \mid \mid f(A^{(i)}) - f(P^{(i)}) \mid \mid_2^2 - \mid \mid f(A^{(i)}) - f(N^{(i)}) \mid \mid_2^2+ \alpha \large ] \small_+ \tag{3}$$

*Hints*:

- Useful functions: `tf.reduce_sum()`, `tf.square()`, `tf.subtract()`, `tf.add()`, `tf.maximum()`.

- For steps 1 and 2, sum over the entries of $\mid \mid f(A^{(i)}) - f(P^{(i)}) \mid \mid_2^2$ and $\mid \mid     f(A^{(i)}) - f(N^{(i)}) \mid \mid_2^2$.

- For step 4, you will sum over the training examples.

*Additional Hints*:

- Recall that the square of the L2 norm is the sum of the squared differences: $||x - y||_{2}^{2} = \sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_{i} - y_{i})^{2}$

- Note that the anchor, positive and negative encodings are of shape (*m*,128), where *m* is the number of training examples and 128 is the number of elements used to encode a single example.

- For steps 1 and 2, maintain the number of *m* training examples and sum along the 128 values of each encoding. `tf.reduce_sum` has an axis parameter. This chooses along which axis the sums are applied.

- Note that one way to choose the last axis in a tensor is to use negative indexing (axis=-1).

- In step 4, when summing over training examples, the result will be a single scalar value.

- For `tf.reduce_sum` to sum across all axes, keep the default value axis=None.

            negative -- the encodings for the negative images, of shape (None, 128)
    
    Returns:
    loss -- real number, value of the loss
    """
    
    anchor, positive, negative = y_pred[0], y_pred[1], y_pred[2]
    
    ### START CODE HERE
    #(≈ 4 lines)
    # Step 1: Compute the (encoding) distance between the anchor and the positive
    pos_dist = tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(tf.subtract(anchor, positive)), axis = -1)
    # Step 2: Compute the (encoding) distance between the anchor and the negative
    neg_dist = tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(tf.subtract(anchor, negative)), axis = -1)
    # Step 3: subtract the two previous distances and add alpha.
    basic_loss = tf.add(tf.subtract(pos_dist, neg_dist), alpha)
    # Step 4: Take the maximum of basic_loss and 0.0. Sum over the training examples.
    loss = tf.reduce_sum(tf.maximum(basic_loss, 0))
    ### END CODE HERE
    
    return loss
```

## 4 - Loading the Pre-trained Model

FaceNet is trained by minimizing the triplet loss. But since training requires a lot of data and a lot of computation, you won't train it from scratch here. Instead, you'll load a previously trained model in the following cell; which might take a couple of minutes to run.

```python
FRmodel = model
```

## 5 - Applying the model
### Face Verification
Now we'll build a database containing one encoding vector for each person who is allowed to enter the office. to generate the encoding, you'll use `img_to_encoding(image_path, model)`, which runs the forward propagation of the model on the specified image.
- The following code builds the database

```python
#tf.keras.backend.set_image_data_format('channels_last')
def img_to_encoding(image_path, model):
    img = tf.keras.preprocessing.image.load_img(image_path, target_size=(160, 160))
    img = np.around(np.array(img) / 255.0, decimals=12)
    x_train = np.expand_dims(img, axis=0)
    embedding = model.predict_on_batch(x_train)
    return embedding / np.linalg.norm(embedding, ord=2)
```

```python
database = {}
database["danielle"] = img_to_encoding("images/danielle.png", FRmodel)
database["younes"] = img_to_encoding("images/younes.jpg", FRmodel)
database["tian"] = img_to_encoding("images/tian.jpg", FRmodel)
database["andrew"] = img_to_encoding("images/andrew.jpg", FRmodel)
database["kian"] = img_to_encoding("images/kian.jpg", FRmodel)
database["dan"] = img_to_encoding("images/dan.jpg", FRmodel)
database["sebastiano"] = img_to_encoding("images/sebastiano.jpg", FRmodel)
database["bertrand"] = img_to_encoding("images/bertrand.jpg", FRmodel)
database["kevin"] = img_to_encoding("images/kevin.jpg", FRmodel)
database["felix"] = img_to_encoding("images/felix.jpg", FRmodel)
database["benoit"] = img_to_encoding("images/benoit.jpg", FRmodel)
database["arnaud"] = img_to_encoding("images/arnaud.jpg", FRmodel)
```

#### Example images
```python
danielle = tf.keras.preprocessing.image.load_img("images/danielle.png", target_size=(160, 160))
kian = tf.keras.preprocessing.image.load_img("images/kian.jpg", target_size=(160, 160))
```
```python
np.around(np.array(kian) / 255.0, decimals=12).shape
```

![[Pasted image 20211220172530.png]]

### Exercise 2 - verify

Implement the `verify()` function, which checks if the front-door camera picture (`image_path`) is actually the person called "identity". You will have to go through the following steps:

- Compute the encoding of the image from `image_path`.
- Compute the distance between this encoding and the encoding of the identity image stored in the database.
- Open the door if the distance is less than 0.7, else do not open it.

As presented above, you should use the L2 distance `np.linalg.norm`.

**Note**: In this implementation, compare the L2 distance, not the square of the L2 distance, to the threshold 0.7.

*Hints*:

- `identity` is a string that is also a key in the database dictionary.
- `img_to_encoding` has two parameters: the `image_path` and `model`.

```python
# UNQ_C2(UNIQUE CELL IDENTIFIER, DO NOT EDIT)
# GRADED FUNCTION: verify

def verify(image_path, identity, database, model):
    """
    Function that verifies if the person on the "image_path" image is "identity".
    
    Arguments:
        image_path -- path to an image
        identity -- string, name of the person you'd like to verify the identity. Has to be an employee who works in the office.
        database -- python dictionary mapping names of allowed people's names (strings) to their encodings (vectors).
        model -- your Inception model instance in Keras
    
    Returns:
        dist -- distance between the image_path and the image of "identity" in the database.
        door_open -- True, if the door should open. False otherwise.
    """
    ### START CODE HERE
    # Step 1: Compute the encoding for the image. Use img_to_encoding() see example above. (≈ 1 line)
    encoding = img_to_encoding(image_path, model)
    # Step 2: Compute distance with identity's image (≈ 1 line)
    dist = np.linalg.norm(encoding - database[identity], ord = 2) 
    # Step 3: Open the door if dist < 0.7, else don't open (≈ 3 lines)
    if dist < 0.7:
        print("It's " + str(identity) + ", welcome in!")
        door_open = True
    else:
        print("It's not " + str(identity) + ", please go away")
        door_open = False
    ### END CODE HERE        
    return dist, door_open
```

### 5.2 - Face Recognition

Your face verification system is mostly working. But since Kian got his ID card stolen, when he came back to the office the next day he couldn't get in!

To solve this, you'd like to change your face verification system to a face recognition system. This way, no one has to carry an ID card anymore. An authorized person can just walk up to the building, and the door will unlock for them!

You'll implement a face recognition system that takes as input an image, and figures out if it is one of the authorized persons (and if so, who). Unlike the previous face verification system, you will no longer get a person's name as one of the inputs.

<a name='ex-3'></a>
### Exercise 3 - who_is_it

Implement `who_is_it()` with the following steps:

- Compute the target encoding of the image from `image_path`
- Find the encoding from the database that has smallest distance with the target encoding.
- Initialize the `min_dist` variable to a large enough number (100). This helps you keep track of the closest encoding to the input's encoding.
- Loop over the database dictionary's names and encodings. To loop use for (name, db_enc) in `database.items()`.
- Compute the L2 distance between the target "encoding" and the current "encoding" from the database. If this distance is less than the min_dist, then set min_dist to dist, and identity to name.

```python
# UNQ_C3(UNIQUE CELL IDENTIFIER, DO NOT EDIT)
# GRADED FUNCTION: who_is_it

def who_is_it(image_path, database, model):
    """
    Implements face recognition for the office by finding who is the person on the image_path image.

        model -- your Inception model instance in Keras
    
    Returns:
        min_dist -- the minimum distance between image_path encoding and the encodings from the database
        identity -- string, the name prediction for the person on image_path
    """
    
    ### START CODE HERE

    ## Step 1: Compute the target "encoding" for the image. Use img_to_encoding() see example above. ## (≈ 1 line)

    # Initialize "min_dist" to a large value, say 100 (≈1 line)
    min_dist = 100

        # Compute L2 distance between the target "encoding" and the current db_enc from the database. (≈ 1 line)
        dist = np.linalg.norm(encoding - db_enc, ord = 2)

        # If this distance is less than the min_dist, then set min_dist to dist, and identity to name. (≈ 3 lines)
        if dist < min_dist:
            min_dist = dist
            identity = name
    ### END CODE HERE
    
    if min_dist > 0.7:
        print("Not in the database.")
    else:
        print ("it's " + str(identity) + ", the distance is " + str(min_dist))
        
    return min_dist, identity
```

**Ways to improve your facial recognition model**:

Although you won't implement these here, here are some ways to further improve the algorithm:

- Put more images of each person (under different lighting conditions, taken on different days, etc.) into the database. Then, given a new image, compare the new face to multiple pictures of the person. This would increase accuracy.

- Crop the images to contain just the face, and less of the "border" region around the face. This preprocessing removes some of the irrelevant pixels around the face, and also makes the algorithm more robust.
