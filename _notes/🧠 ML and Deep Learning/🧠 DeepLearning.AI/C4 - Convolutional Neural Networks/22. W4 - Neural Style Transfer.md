## What are deep ConvNets learning?

### Visualizing what a deep network is learning

- Pick a unit layer $l$
- Find the image patches that maximize the unit's activation.
- Repeat for other units.


### Cost functions
![[Captura de Pantalla 2021-12-17 a la(s) 21.52.08.png]]

$$J(G) = \alpha J_{content}(C, G) + \beta J_style(S,G)$$

#### Find the generated image $G$
1. Initiate $G$ randomly.
2. Use gradient descent to minimize $J(G)$

`CostFunction`

#### Content Cost Function
- Say you use hidden layer $l$ to compute content cost.
	- Neither too shallow nor to deep.
- Use pre-trained ConvNet like #VGG16 
- Let $a^{[l](C)}$ and $a^{[l](G)}$ be the activation of layer $l$ on the images.
- If $a^{[l](C)}$ and $a^{[l](G)}$ are similar, both images have similar content:

$$J_{content}(C,G) = \frac{1}{2}||a^{[l](C)} - a^{[l](G)}  ||^2$$

#### Style Cost Function

##### Style definition
- Meaning of the ==style== of an image:
	- To measure the *style* of the layer $l$ => we will use its activations $a^l$
	- Define ==style== as:
		- The correlation between activations across channels
		- *How correlated are the activations across different channels?*
		- The correlation tell us which of the high level texture components (channels) tend to occur or not occur together in a part of the image.

- So the idea is to preserve that correlation between channels (the ==style==) from the `input` image into the `output` image.

##### Style formalization
###### Style matrix $G$
- Let $a_{i,j,k}^l$ = activation at $(i,j,k)$
	- $i$ -> high
	- $j$ -> width
	- $k$ -> channel
- $G^l$ is a matrix in $n_c^l \times n_c^l$
	- $G$ stands for *grand matrix*
	- This is the ==style== matrix between channels $k$ and $k'$:
	- $G^l_{kk'} = \sum_{i=1}^{n_H^l} \sum_{j=1}^{n_W^l} a_{i,j,k} \cdot a_{i,j,k'}$
	- <mark style='background-color: #9CE684 !important'>Note:</mark> More than a *correlation* matrix, $G$ is the unnormalized *covariance* matrix
- $G$ should be computed both from the `style` image $S$ and the `generated` image $R$

##### Style cost function
###### Per layer
It is the [[Frobenius norm]] between two style matrices $S$ and $R$:
- $J_{style}^l(S, R) = || G^{l(S)} - G^{l(R)} ||^2_F$
- $J_{style}^l(S, R) = \frac{1}{2n_H^l n_W^l n_c^l} \sum_k \sum_{k'}(G^{lS}_{kk'} - G^{lR}_{kk'} )^2$

###### For all layers
The ==style cost function== for all layers:
- $J_{style}^l(S, R) = \sum_l \lambda^l J_{style}^l(S,R)$
	- where $\lambda$ is a hyperparameter 

### Overall cost function
To evaluate the `generated` image $R$

$$ J(R) = \alpha J_{content}(C, R) + \beta J_{style}(S, R) $$
