- # Detection Algorithms

## Object localization
- Identifying the localization of one or more objects in an image and drawing abounding box around their extend.
	- Specifying a tightly croppend bounding box centered on the instance

#### The target label `y`
For a prediction task with 3 classes: $c_1, c_2, c_3$,

$
\begin{align}
    y &= \begin{bmatrix}
           p_c \\
           b_x \\
           b_u \\
           b_h \\
		   b_w \\
		   c_1 \\
		   c_2 \\
		   c_3 
         \end{bmatrix}
  \end{align},
$

- where $p_c$ determines whether an object of any class is in the image ($1$) or not ($0$).
- Also, $b_x$ and $b_y$ indicate the position in $x$ and $y$ where the left top corner of the box starts. They are measured as portions of the image.
- Finally, $b_h$ and $b_w$ are the `height` and `width` of the surrounding box, measured in terms of proportions.

## Landmark detection
- Landmark detection is a computer vision task where we want to detect and track keypoints from a given object.

## Object Detection
### Sliding windows detection
This is an option to perform object detection. However it is ==computationally expensive==
- This approach ==was== ok when simpler classifiers were used:
	- Like linear models
##### Implementation
- Train a [[Fully Convolutional Networks]] using crop images of the object you want to detect:
	- Example => car images
![[Captura de Pantalla 2021-12-07 a la(s) 17.11.45.png]]

- Use different window sizes to sweep the image, at each step, use the trained `ConvNet` to determine if there is a car inside the image.

#### Convolutional implementation of sliding windows
For a task predicting four classes:
- In this example, instead of running the #ConvNet four times for each window, you can implement a single #ConvNet that outputs a matrix of `2x2x4`
	- Each cell inside the matix is the prediction for each of the `four` classes, for each of the `four` windows 
![[Captura de Pantalla 2021-12-08 a la(s) 19.06.57.png]]

Now with `8` sliding windows per row ->
- The output will be of size `8x8x4`

### Bounding box predictions
#YOLO algorithm => *You Only Look Once*
- It combines [[#Object localization]] with the use of grids

![[Captura de Pantalla 2021-12-08 a la(s) 19.13.03.png]]

- The bounding box is specified relative to each grid cell.
- The **center** of the bounding box is reported by $b_x$ and $b_y$
	- Their value is between 0 and 1.
- The box dimensions can be greater than 1 in the case that the object being greater then the grid cell

### Intersection Over Union
==Evaluating [[#Object localization]]== => By using `IoU`: *Intersection over Union*
-> It is a measure of the overlap between two bounding boxes.

$$IoU = \frac{Intersection}{Union}$$
- One convention is that if $IoU \ge 0.5$ -> The prediction will be ==correct==

### Non-max Suppression
*"Suppress the `non-maximal` predictions"*
-> [[#Non-max Suppression]] is a way to assure the algorithm will detect the object only once even if the object appears in multiple cells:

- Below, the cars appear in multiple cells
- ![[Captura de Pantalla 2021-12-08 a la(s) 19.48.25.png]]

Keep the prediction with the greatest $p_c$
