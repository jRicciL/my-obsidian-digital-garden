# EfficientNet
#EfficientNet
- A type of #CNN Network
- Scale the network to a particular device constrains

#### The idea
The idea is to vary among three different values that affect the consumption of resources by the network:
	- The resolution of the input image => $r$
	- The Depth of the network => $d$
	- The size (wide) of the layers => $w$

The objective is to find the best trade-off between `r`, `d`, and `w` -> Given a computational device
- => in order to get the best possible performance given the resources constrains
