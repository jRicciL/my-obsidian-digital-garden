# Error Analysis

## Carrying out error analysis
- Look at the examples that the algorithm is miss classifying...

### Error analysis
- Get ~100 mislabeled `dev` set examples
- Count up how many are `Negatives`
	- Is the ML model bad at recognizing `Negative` or `Postitive` examples?
	
#### Evaluate multiple ideas in parallel
- Fix examples or instances
- Create a table with each of the miss classified examples
	- Use the table to take notes and comments, including ideas on how improve each of the examples used for validation/training

### Cleaning up incorrectly labeled data
- Identify miss labeled data:
	- In the `training` set
	- In the `dev` and `test` sets
- Deep learning algorithms are quite robust to **random errors** in the training set.
	- But not to **systematic errors**
- Identify how much the ==incorrect labels== affect the performance of the model

## Build the first System Quickly => then iterate

<mark style='background-color: #9CE684 !important'>Build the first system quickly and then iterate.</mark>

1. Set up the `dev`/`test` sets
2. Select the metric
3. Build the initial systiem quickly
4. Use ==Bias/Variance== analysis and ==Error analysis== to prioritize the next steps.
