# End-to-end Deep Learning

<mark >Carefully chose what types of $X \rightarrow y$ mappings we want to learn depending on the types of the data </mark>

## What is end-to-end deep learning?
- Let the Neural Network do the whole process
- It requires a lot of data compared with the modular, traditional pipeline
- But lot of tasks are better solved using the multi stage approach
	- Because it simplifies the problem
	- ðŸ”´  There is less data to map $X \rightarrow y$ using the end-to-end approach
	- ðŸŸ¢  There is more data mapping between each stage of the multi-stage approach

## Whether to use End-to-end approach

#### Benefits
1. Lets the data "speak"
	- It could capture the true relation between $X$ and $y$
2. Less hand-designing of components needed

#### Cons:
1. It requires a large amount of data
2. Excludes potentially useful hand-designed components
	1. That could make the model more simple
	2. Hand design components could be useful

### The Key question
- *Do you have sufficient data to learn a function of the complexity needed to map $X$ to $y$*
