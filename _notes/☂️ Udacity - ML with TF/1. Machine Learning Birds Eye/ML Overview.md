# Statistical Perspective

- Mathematical function were used to describe the phenomena of the real world.

### Computer science perspective
- Looking at data to recognize patterns
- Rules based on distributions
- Flexible and complex models based in more data
	- Predict better than previous models
	- But we often dont know why do they make the decisions they make

## Machine Learning Types
![[Captura de Pantalla 2021-12-27 a la(s) 20.19.01.png]]

#### Supervised Learning
- ==labeled Data==
	- Classification => $y$ is a category
		- Binary
		- Multiclass
	- Regression => 
		- $y$ is a numerical value

#### Unsupervised Learning
- Creates models with unlabeled data
	- Applications
		- Feature Selection
		- REcomendation Systems
		- Grouping / Clustering

#### Reinforcement Learning
An agent that recieves rewards for a given set of actions through a environment context.
- Self driving cars
- Gameplays

There are a number of obstacles in training these algorithms, and the approaches are not as streamlined as the other approaches 

## Deep Learning
- Flexible models
- Good performances
- Barriers
	- Requires a lot of data
	- Requires a lot of computing resources
	- Low explainability

## Ethics in Machine Learning
- The models could **inherit** the ==biases== and ==errors== from the data
	- Humans create this data
	- This biases should be always in our mind
