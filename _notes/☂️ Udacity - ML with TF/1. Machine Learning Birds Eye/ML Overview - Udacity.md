# Machine Learning Birds Eye

### Statistical Perspective

- Mathematical ==functions== have been used to describe the phenomena of the real world.

### Computer science perspective
- Looking at `data` to recognize `patterns`
- `Rules` based on `distributions`
- Flexible and complex models based in more data
	- Predict better than previous models
	- But we often don't know *why* do they make the decisions they make

## Machine Learning Types

#### Supervised Learning
- ==Labeled Data==
	- **Classification** => $y$ is a category
		- Binary
		- Multi-class
	- **Regression** => 
		- $y$ is a numerical value

#### Unsupervised Learning
- Creates models with ==unlabeled data==
	- Applications
		- *Feature Selection*
		- *Feature extraction*
		- *Recomendation Systems*
		- *Grouping / Clustering*

#### Reinforcement Learning
An <mark style='background-color: #FFA793 !important'>agent</mark> that receives <mark style='background-color: #9CE684 !important'>rewards</mark> for a given set of ==actions== through a <mark style='background-color: #93EBFF !important'>environment context</mark>
- Self driving cars
- Gameplays

There are a number of obstacles in training these algorithms, and the approaches are not as streamlined as the other approaches 

## Deep Learning üß†
- **Flexible** models
- Good **performances**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Barriers
	- Requires *a lot of data*
	- Requires *a lot of computing resources*
	- Low **explainability**

## Ethics in Machine Learning
- The models could **inherit** the ==biases== and ==errors== from the data
	- Humans create this data
	- This biases should be always in our mind
