Here is what you need to know about the Final Assessment:

-   The Final Assessment will be opened on **Feb 11, 2022 at 10 am PT** for all learners, and will close on **February 18, 2022 at 10 am PT.** There will be no other dates available to sit for the assessment.
-   The assessment is completely online.
-   Learners will receive a link to take the assessment via email once the assessment is available on **Feb 11, 2022 at 10 am PT.**
-   The Final Assessment link expires **exactly on February 18, 2022 at 10 am PT after it is made available.** Therefore, we recommend eligible students to start their Final Assessment well in advance of the link expiration time **as the assessment will terminate automatically by this time,** and it will be closed, whether you were able to answer all the questions by then or not.
-   **The Final Assessment can be attempted only once.** So, please prepare well before the assessment.
-   The Final Assessment **duration is 60 minutes only from the moment you start the assessment.** You’ll be able to see a countdown timer on the screen. Please note that you can’t pause the time, and once the timer reaches 0 seconds, the assessment will be automatically submitted whether you’re able to answer all the questions or not. So, make sure to start the assessment when you’re ready for that.
-   The assessment consists of 5 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) about your track content.
-   This assessment tests your knowledge in the track you completed in the Challenge phase.
-   **You cannot return to any previous question once you have answered or skipped it.** So, make sure you take the time to thoughtfully answer each question.
-   Learners who get selected will be notified about their selection status for a Udacity Nanodegree Program Scholarship. **This status update will be sent directly to participants via email on February 25, 2022.** Please make sure to check your inbox (and spam and promotions folders) frequently during this period.
-   If you’ll be selected for the Nanodegree Program Scholarship, you’ll start the program on March 1, 2022.
