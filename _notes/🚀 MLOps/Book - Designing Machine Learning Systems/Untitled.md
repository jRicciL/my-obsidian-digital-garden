# C1: Overview of Machine Learning Systems
#Book #MLOps 

- ML Systems are both complex and unique.
	- They consist of many different  components and involve many different stakeholders. 
- Data scientists:
	- An umbrella terms to include anyone who works developing and deploying M: models
- **==MLOps==**:
	- Sonsiders an ML system holistically to ensure that all the components and their stakeholders can work together to satisfy the specific objectives and requirements.
- The algorithm is only a small part of an ML system
	- The system also includes business requirements
	- Interface where users and developers interact
	- Data stack
	- Logic for developing, monitoring and updating the models

## When to use Machine Learning
#MachineLearning #MLOps 
- ML is not a magic.tool that can solve all problems
- ML solutions might not be the optimal solutions
- Always ask whether ML is necessary or cost-effective
### What is machine learning?
> Machine Learning is an approach to learn complex patterns from existing data and use these patterns to make predictions on unseen data.

### Learn: 
*The system has the capacity to learn*
- There must be something for it to learn
### Complex:
*Complex patterns* → there are patterns to learn, and they are complex 
- Whether a pattern exists might not be obvious.
	- The ML might not be enough to capture the.
### Existing data
Data is available, or it’s possible to collect data
- There must be data to learn from it.
### Predictions
Its a predictive problem
- Estimate a value in the future
### Unseen data
- ML models only useful when unseen data share patterns with the training data.
	- Same distributions → We make this assumption
### Is repetitive
- Many ML algorithms require many examples to learn a pattern.
### The cost of wrong predictions is cheap
- ML is specially suitable when the cost of a wrong prediction is low.
- Or if, on average, the benefits of correct predicition outweigh the cost of wrong predicitons.
### It’s a scale
- Making a lot of predicitons.

### The patterns are constantly changing
- ML learns from data → you can update the model with new data.

## Machine Learning Usecases

- Fraud detection
- Price optimization
- Forecast customer demand
- Reducing customer adquisition costs
- Churn prediction
- Automated support ticket classification
- Brand monitoring → How the public and consumers percibe your brand
	- Sentiment analysis
