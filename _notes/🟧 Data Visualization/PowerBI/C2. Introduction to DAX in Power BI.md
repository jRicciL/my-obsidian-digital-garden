# Introduction to DAX in Power BI

- Data Analysis Expressions
	- Predefined formulas that perform calculations on specific values
- Formula language to create calculations
	- Columns, tables, measures
- Based on ==Excel== formulas and functions

### Calculated columns
- Expannds our existing datasets without editing the source
- Evaluates at a row level and adds a new column to an existing table
- Calculated at data load and when the data is refreshed

#### Example
- DAX example:
	- `Price_w_tax` = `Price` + (`Price` * `Tax`*)

### Calculated measures
- Enables complex calculations
- Aggregates multiple rows and adds a new field that can be added to visualizations
- Calculated at query time as you interact and filter
- Created by two ways:
	- Write a measure from scratch
	- Use the built-in Quick Measure tool
- It is a good practice to create a new table named `_Calculations` to store the calculated measures during our analysis

## Context
- Enables dynamic analysis where the results of a formula change to reflect the selected data
- Three types:
	1. `row`
	2. `filter`
	3. `query`

### Introduction to Row context
- The current row

#### Measures
- Can apply when using iterator functions which compute calculations row by row
- Iterator functions can be identified by an `X` after the function name `SUMX()`
- Syntax
	- `SUMX(<table>, <expression>)`

### Filter Context
- Set of filters that have been applied before the calculation is carried out
- Can be applied by:
	- Attributes in a row/column
	- Via a slicer
	- Through the filter pane
	- In a calculated measure

### `CALCULATE` function
- Syntax:
	- `CALCULATE(<expression>[, <filter1> [, <filter2> [, ...]]]`
	- Expression: a measure or calculation to be evaluated -> Must return a single value
	- Filters:
		- Filters need to evaluate as a table
		- Filters should not clash with one another
		- Filters will always override filters from the visualization
