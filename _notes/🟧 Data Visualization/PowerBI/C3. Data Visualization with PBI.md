## When designed a dashboard
- Who is your intended audience?
- How will they use your dashboard?
- What actions do you want to them to take as a result of what you show?
- Are you showing the right measures in the right way?

## Reducing cognitive load 

1. Tailor the page to your audience
2. Focus on one story per report page
3. Strike the balance between information-rich visuals and confusing the audience
4. Remove borders, expressive backgrounds, and shapes which do not convey information
5. Use visuals the users already understand
6. Focus on one story per page

## Less is more

### Keys to good visual design
**Before adding something to a dashboard**
1. Does this contribute to the story?
2. Is the right visual element?
3. Is this visual element necessary?

- Help business track how they are doing versus relevant metrics.

## Shares, guages and KPIs

#KPI -> Track performances over time vs expectations
