## Introduction to Power Query

Why prepare data?

Clean data:
- Free from missing values
- No typos 
- Correct data type errors
- No duplicated data
- Irrelevant data is excluded
- Manage outliers (depends on the requirements)
- Descriptive names for columns and rows

### Power Query
- Used to load and transform data inside Power BI
- Transformation steps are added sequentially
- Steps are saved in a **recipe** called ==applied steps== =>
	- It executes every time the data is load or refreshed

### Data types in Power Query
- Numerical Data:
	- Decimal, Integer, Percentage
- Date / Time data
- Text Data
- Logical Data
- Binary Data

### Basic structural transformation of data
- Promote headers
- Reorder columns
- Sort columns 
- Remove columns/rows

## Clean the data
### Why should you clean the data
- ðŸŸ¢ Cost of bat data ðŸ’¸ => $3.1 trillion

#### The 1-10-100 rule
- $1 to verify
- $10 to clean
- $100 if we do nothing

## Data Preview features in Power Query

#### What is data preview?
- Set of features that allow to analyze the data in Power Query
- Can be found under the View ribbon of Power Query

- ðŸš¨ ==Based in first 1000 rows== by default

#### Why use data preview?
- Helps diagnose errors and incosistencies in the dataset
- shows how a transformation affected the dataset
- Enables quick analysis of some columns and helps to decide what transformations to use
- Can be used as a quickly way to apply some column transformations
- It can be accessed by hovering over the output of the data preview feature

## Transforming text in Power Query

- Free from typos => Better fix it in the source
- Consistently formatted
	- Data points are consistently represented
	- Uniform capitalization
	- No leading or trailing whitespace
	- No punctuation or control characters
- Ideally, each column will only store one piece of information

### Trim & clean text
- ðŸ”´ Should be always applied to the text columns

### Split or merge columns by text

## Numerical Transformations in PowerBI

#### What is cleaning numerical data?
- Free from missing values / error
- Deal with outliears
- Mathematical transformations required
	- Absolute value
	- Logarithm
	- Multiplying by an scalar value
- Data is ounded to the appropriate number of digits

#### Dealing with dates
- Date (and time) is considered as a separate data type in PowerBI
- Special transformations can be applied to a date column
	- Extract year, quarter, month, week, day
	- Start/end of year, quarter, month, week
	- Extract age
