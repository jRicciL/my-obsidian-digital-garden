## Introduction to pandas for marketing
### Data Scientists on a marketing team
- Analyzing marketing campaign performance
- Attributing credit for conversions to marketing channels
- A/B testing

#### About pandas
- Important notes
	- use `.head()`
	- use `.describe()`
		- Keep attention to minimum and maximum values

#### Data types and data merging
- Use the `dtypes()` function
- Change type with `col.astype('bool')` method
- Creating new boolean columns with `np.where`

```python
data['new_col'] = np.where(
	data['col'] == 'Some value', 
	# Below arguments can be changed
	True, False
)
```

##### Feature Engineering

```python
# Mapping for channels
channel_dict = {"House Ads": 1, "Instagram": 2, 
                "Facebook": 3, "Email": 4, "Push": 5}

# Map the channel to a channel code
marketing['channel_code'] = marketing['subscribing_channel'].map(channel_dict)

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Add the new column is_correct_lang
marketing['is_correct_lang'] = np.where(
    marketing['language_preferred'] == marketing['language_displayed'],
    'Yes', 'No'
)
```

- Mapping values to existing columns
```python
# Can be used to change the values of a given column
features_dict = {
	'Old_value': 'New_value',
	'Old_value2': 'New_value2'
}
```

##### Date Columns
- Use `parse_dates` argument while reading a file
```python
# While loading the data
marketing = pd.read_csv('file.csv',
					   parse_dates = ['Col1', 'Col2']
					   )
```

- Use `pd.to_datetime()` to parse a column to a datetime type
- Use time attributes to extract relevant information
	- From a `datetime` column use `.dt.dayofweek` => Returns the day of the week in a numerical format

### Initial Exploratory Analysis

##### Aggregate values
```python
marketing.groupby(['column_to_agg'])\
				  ['column_for_count'].nunique()
```

## Introduction to common marketing metrics

==Translate business question into measurable outcomes==

**- How to measure marketing campaign success?**
### ðŸ”´ **Conversion rate:**
- Ration between the number of people converted to the product over the number of people we marketed to

```python
# Calculate the number of people we marketed to
total = marketing['user_id'].nunique()

# Calculate the number of people who subscribed
subscribers = marketing.query('converted == True')['user_id'].nunique()

# Calculate the conversion rate
conversion_rate = subscribers / total
print(round(conversion_rate*100, 2), "%")
```
		
### ðŸ”µ **Retention rate:**
- percentage of people that remained subscribed after a certain period of time

```python
# Calculate the number of subscribers
total_subscribers = marketing.query('converted == True')['user_id'].nunique()

# Calculate the number of people who remained subscribed
retained = marketing.query('is_retained == True')['user_id'].nunique()

# Calculate the retention rate
retention_rate = retained / total_subscribers
print(round(retention_rate*100, 2), "%")
```

### Customer Segmentation
- It is important to segment costumer by who you're marketing to.

#### Segmenting
- Breaking down metrics by specific characteristics.
- We could perform some evaluations or metrics grouping our data by different properties or features
	- Age
	- Gender
	- Location
	- Past interactions with the business
	- MArketing channels users interacted with

- ðŸ”´ Use `groupby()`

```python
# Group by date_served and count unique users
total = marketing.groupby('date_served')['user_id'].nunique()

# Group by date_served and count unique converted users
subscribers = marketing.query('converted')\
                       .groupby('date_served')['user_id'].nunique()

# Calculate the conversion rate per day
daily_conversion_rate = subscribers/total
print(daily_conversion_rate)
```

### Plotting campaign results

```python
# Create a line chart using daily_conversion_rate DataFrame
daily_conversion_rate.plot('date_subscribed', 
                           'conversion_rate')

plt.title('Daily conversion rate\n', size = 16)
plt.ylabel('Conversion rate (%)', size = 14)
plt.xlabel('Date', size = 14)

# Set the y-axis to begin at 0
plt.ylim(0)

# Display the plot
plt.show()
```


## A/B testing
==Randomized experiment to evaluate which variant performs better==

- ðŸŸ¢ We need a control
	- Usually the actual status of the product/service
	- It is something that currently exists and is running in production
- ðŸ”µ Each variant in the test should have only one major change from the control
	- Identify key metrics => Key Performance Indicator

![[Pasted image 20220421230224.png]]

#### Prior to running the test determine:
1. What is ==the desired outcome== of the test?
	1. What is our ==hyphotesis==?
2. What is the **metric** we are trying to impact?
	1. Page views, conversions
3. Will we get enough traffic to our site to **reach statistical significance** and make a decision in a timely manner?

#### Check if the test ran correctly
- ==Allocation== The number of users/idividuals should be balanced across the different variants
	- There are statistical tests to determine the likelihood that the difference in allocation is due to random chance
	
## Calculating LIFT
#lift and #significanceTesting

### Lift calculation:
![[Captura de Pantalla 2022-04-30 a la(s) 21.39.11.png]]
- (Treatment conversion rate) - (Control conversion rate) / (Control conversion rate)
- ==Result==: The relative percent difference treatment (B) compared to control (A)

```python
# Claculate the mean of a and b
a_mean = np.mean(control)
b_mean = np.mean(treatment_b)

# Calculate the lift
lift = (b_mean - a_mean) / a_mean
lift_pct = lift * 100
```

## Statistical significance
### t-student test for independent samples
- **Two sample** #t-test
	- A #t-test uses the mean and the sample variance to determine the ==likelihood== that the variation between the two samples occurred by chance

- #p-value:
	- t-statistic of 1.96 is typically statistically significant at a 95% level
	- Depending on the context of the test, you may be comfortable with a lower or higher level

```python
def ab_segmentation(segment):
  # Build a for loop for each segment in marketing
  for subsegment in np.unique(marketing[segment].values):
      print(subsegment)
      
      # Limit marketing to email and subsegment      
      email = marketing[(marketing['marketing_channel'] == 'Email') & (marketing[segment] == subsegment)]

      subscribers = email.groupby(['user_id', 'variant'])['converted'].max()
      subscribers = pd.DataFrame(subscribers.unstack(level=1)) 
      control = subscribers['control'].dropna()
      personalization = subscribers['personalization'].dropna()

      print('lift:', lift(control, personalization))
      print('t-statistic:', stats.ttest_ind(control, personalization), '\n\n')
```
