# Time Series Analysis in SQL Server

## Working with dates and times

- Translate strings to dates
- Filtering, grouping, and aggregating data
- Upsampling and downsampling data
- Window functions

### Building a date

```sql
SELECT
	GETDATE() AS DateTime_LTz, -- Local date time
	GETUTCDATE() AS DateTime_UTC; -- UTC date time
```


```sql
SELECT
	SYSDATETIME() AS DateTime_LTz, -- Local date time
	SYSUTCDATETIME() AS DateTime_UTC; -- UTC date time
```

### Breaking down a date
- Use `DATETIME2(x)`: Where `x` is used to define the number of fractional seconds precision

```sql
DECLARE
	@SomeDate DATETIME2(3) = '2019-03-01 08:17:19.332'
	
SELECT YEAR(@SomeDate)

SELECT MONTH(@SomeDate)

SELECT DAY(@SomeDate)
```

```sql
DECLARE
	@SomeTime DATETIME2(7) = SYSUTCDATETIME();

-- Retrieve the year, month, and day
SELECT
	YEAR(@SomeTime) AS TheYear,
	MONTH(@SomeTime) AS TheMonth,
	DAY(@SomeTime) AS TheDay;
```

### Parsing dates with date parts => `PARTS`
- Use `DATEPART()` => To get a numerical value
- use `DATENAME()` => To get the string representation

![[Captura de Pantalla 2022-05-10 a la(s) 21.38.30.png]]

##### DatePart

```sql
DECLARE
	@BerlinWallFalls DATETIME2(7) = '1989-11-09 23:49:36.2294852';

-- Fill in each date part
SELECT
	DATEPART(YEAR, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheYear,
	DATEPART(MONTH, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheMonth,
	DATEPART(DAY, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheDay,
	DATEPART(DAYOFYEAR, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheDayOfYear,
    -- Day of week is WEEKDAY
	DATEPART(WEEKDAY, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheDayOfWeek,
	DATEPART(WEEK, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheWeek,
	DATEPART(SECOND, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheSecond,
	DATEPART(NANOSECOND, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheNanosecond;
```

##### DateName
- Gives different results from `DATEPART` with `month` and `dayOfWeek`

```sql
DECLARE
	@BerlinWallFalls DATETIME2(7) = '1989-11-09 23:49:36.2294852';

-- Fill in the function to show the name of each date part
SELECT
	DATENAME(YEAR, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheYear,
	DATENAME(MONTH, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheMonth,
	DATENAME(DAY, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheDay,
	DATENAME(DAYOFYEAR, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheDayOfYear,
    -- Day of week is WEEKDAY
	DATENAME(WEEKDAY, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheDayOfWeek,
	DATENAME(WEEK, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheWeek,
	DATENAME(SECOND, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheSecond,
	DATENAME(NANOSECOND, @BerlinWallFalls) AS TheNanosecond;
```

### Adding and subtracting dates
#### Comparing dates

- Use `DATEDIFF` and `DATEADD` =>
	- It returns an integer and rounds up

##### `DATEADD`

```sql
DECLARE
	@LeapDay DATETIME2(7) = '2012-02-29 18:00:00';

-- Fill in the date parts and intervals as needed
SELECT
	DATEADD(DAY, -1, @LeapDay) AS PriorDay,
	DATEADD(DAY, 1, @LeapDay) AS NextDay,
    -- For leap years, we need to move 4 years, not just 1
	DATEADD(YEAR, -4, @LeapDay) AS PriorLeapYear,
	DATEADD(YEAR, 4, @LeapDay) AS NextLeapYear,
	DATEADD(YEAR, -1, @LeapDay) AS PriorYear;
```

```sql
DECLARE
	@PostLeapDay DATETIME2(7) = '2012-03-01 18:00:00';

-- Fill in the date parts and intervals as needed
SELECT
	DATEADD(DAY, -1, @PostLeapDay) AS PriorDay,
	DATEADD(DAY, 1, @PostLeapDay) AS NextDay,
	DATEADD(YEAR, -4, @PostLeapDay) AS PriorLeapYear,
	DATEADD(YEAR, 4, @PostLeapDay) AS NextLeapYear,
	DATEADD(YEAR, -1, @PostLeapDay) AS PriorYear,
    -- Move 4 years forward and one day back
	DATEADD(DAY, -1, DATEADD(YEAR, 4, @PostLeapDay)) AS NextLeapDay,
    DATEADD(DAY, -2, @PostLeapDay) AS TwoDaysAgo;
```

##### `DATEDIFF`

```sql
DECLARE
	@PostLeapDay DATETIME2(7) = '2012-03-01 18:00:00',
    @TwoDaysAgo DATETIME2(7);

SELECT
	@TwoDaysAgo = DATEADD(DAY, -2, @PostLeapDay);

SELECT
	@TwoDaysAgo AS TwoDaysAgo,
	@PostLeapDay AS SomeTime,
    -- Fill in the appropriate function and date types
	DATEDIFF(DAY, @TwoDaysAgo, @PostLeapDay) AS DaysDifference,
	DATEDIFF(HOUR, @TwoDaysAgo, @PostLeapDay) AS HoursDifference,
	DATEDIFF(MINUTE, @TwoDaysAgo, @PostLeapDay) AS MinutesDifference;
```

#### Round dates

```sql
DECLARE
	@SomeTime DATETIME2(7) = '2018-06-14 16:29:36.2248991';

-- Fill in the appropriate functions and date parts
SELECT
	DATEADD(DAY, DATEDIFF(DAY, 0, @SomeTime), 0) AS RoundedToDay,
	DATEADD(HOUR, DATEDIFF(HOUR, 0, @SomeTime), 0) AS RoundedToHour,
	DATEADD(MINUTE, DATEDIFF(MINUTE, 0, @SomeTime), 0) AS RoundedToMinute;
```

## Formatting dates for reporting

#SQL-Server has three formatting options:
### `CAST()`:
- Useful for converting one data type to another data types including dates
- No control over formatting from dates.
- Almost present in any relational database

```sql
DECLARE
	@CubsWinWorldSeries DATETIME2(3) = '2016-11-03 00:30:29.245',
	@OlderDateType DATETIME = '2016-11-03 00:30:29.245';

SELECT
	-- Fill in the missing function calls
	CAST(@CubsWinWorldSeries AS DATE) AS CubsWinDateForm,
	CAST(@CubsWinWorldSeries AS NVARCHAR(30)) AS CubsWinStringForm,
	CAST(@OlderDateType AS DATE) AS OlderDateForm,
	CAST(@OlderDateType AS NVARCHAR(30)) AS OlderStringForm;
```

```sql
DECLARE
	@CubsWinWorldSeries DATETIME2(3) = '2016-11-03 00:30:29.245';

SELECT
	CAST(CAST(@CubsWinWorldSeries AS DATE) AS NVARCHAR(30)) AS DateStringForm;
```


### `CONVERT()`:
- Can have some control over formatting from dates to strings using the style parameter.
- Specific to T-SQL
- Takes three parameters
	- Data type
	- Input string
	- Optional sytle
	- ![[Captura de Pantalla 2022-05-12 a la(s) 17.38.27.png]]
	- ![[Captura de Pantalla 2022-05-12 a la(s) 17.39.07.png]]

```sql
DECLARE
	@CubsWinWorldSeries DATETIME2(3) = '2016-11-03 00:30:29.245';

SELECT
	CONVERT(DATE, @CubsWinWorldSeries) AS CubsWinDateForm,
	CONVERT(VARCHAR(30), @CubsWinWorldSeries) AS CubsWinStringForm;
```

```sql
DECLARE
	@CubsWinWorldSeries DATETIME2(3) = '2016-11-03 00:30:29.245';

SELECT
	CONVERT(NVARCHAR(30), @CubsWinWorldSeries, 0) AS DefaultForm,
	CONVERT(NVARCHAR(30), @CubsWinWorldSeries, 3) AS UK_dmy,
	CONVERT(NVARCHAR(30), @CubsWinWorldSeries, 1) AS US_mdy,
	CONVERT(NVARCHAR(30), @CubsWinWorldSeries, 103) AS UK_dmyyyy,
	CONVERT(NVARCHAR(30), @CubsWinWorldSeries, 101) AS US_mdyyyy;
```


### `FORMAT()`:
- Much more flexibility than the other two:
	- Takes three parameters:
		-  the input value, the input format, and an optional culture (such as `en-US` for US English or `zh-cn` for Simplified Chinese).
- Only present in T-SQL
- It can be slower than `CAST` and `CONVERT`
- ![[Captura de Pantalla 2022-05-12 a la(s) 17.39.59.png]]

```sql
DECLARE
	@Python3ReleaseDate DATETIME2(3) = '2008-12-03 19:45:00.033';
    
SELECT
	-- 20081203
	FORMAT(@Python3ReleaseDate, 'yyyyMMdd') AS F1,
	-- 2008-12-03
	FORMAT(@Python3ReleaseDate, 'yyyy-MM-dd') AS F2,
	-- Dec 03+2008 (the + is just a "+" character)
	FORMAT(@Python3ReleaseDate, 'MMM dd+yyyy') AS F3,
	-- 12 08 03 (month, two-digit year, day)
	FORMAT(@Python3ReleaseDate, 'MM yy dd') AS F4,
	-- 03 07:45 2008.00
    -- (day hour:minute year.second)
	FORMAT(@Python3ReleaseDate, 'dd hh:mm yyyy.ss') AS F5;
```

## Working with calendar tables

- A ==calendar table== is a table which stores date information for easy retrieval.
- Contents:

### Using a calendar table

![[Captura de Pantalla 2022-05-12 a la(s) 17.54.55.png]]

```sql
-- Find Tuesdays in December for calendar years 2008-2010
SELECT
	c.Date
FROM dbo.Calendar c
WHERE
	c.MonthName = 'December'
	AND c.DayName = 'Tuesday'
	AND c.CalendarYear BETWEEN 2008 AND 2010
ORDER BY
	c.Date;
```

```sql
-- Find fiscal week 29 of fiscal year 2019
SELECT
	c.Date
FROM dbo.Calendar c
WHERE
    -- Instead of month, use the fiscal week
	c.FiscalWeekOfYear = 29
    -- Instead of calendar year, use fiscal year
	AND c.FiscalYear = 2019
ORDER BY
	c.Date ASC;
```

```sql
SELECT
	ir.IncidentDate,
	c.FiscalDayOfYear,
	c.FiscalWeekOfYear
FROM dbo.IncidentRollup ir
	INNER JOIN dbo.Calendar c
		ON ir.IncidentDate = c.Date
WHERE
    -- Incident type 3
	ir.IncidentTypeID = 3
    -- Fiscal year 2019
	AND c.FiscalYear = 2019
    -- Fiscal quarter 3
	AND c.FiscalQuarter = 3;

```

```sql
SELECT
	ir.IncidentDate,
	c.FiscalDayOfYear,
	c.FiscalWeekOfYear
FROM dbo.IncidentRollup ir
	INNER JOIN dbo.Calendar c
		ON ir.IncidentDate = c.Date
WHERE
    -- Incident type 4
	ir.IncidentTypeID = 4
    -- Fiscal year 2019
	AND c.FiscalYear = 2019
    -- Beyond fiscal week of year 30
	AND c.FiscalWeekOfYear > 30
    -- Only return weekends
	AND c.IsWeekend = 1;
