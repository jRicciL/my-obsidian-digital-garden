# Creating and using containers like a Boss

## Containers
- The fundamental building block of the Docker toolkit

## Images vs Containers
- ==Image== =>
	- Is the application we want to run
	- Contains the binaries an scripts required
- ==Container== =>
	- Is an instance of that image running on a process
	- You can have many containers running off the same image

## Check Docker install and `confing`
