# Explain Azure Databricks

-   Fully **managed**, cloud-based Big Data and Machine Learning platform.
-   Empowers developers to accelerate AI and innovation by simplifying the process of building production data applications.
-   Build by the team that create Apache Spark.
-   Azure ==databricks== provides data science and engineering teams with a single platform for Big Data *processing* and Machine Learning.
-   Makes it simple to run large-scale Spark workloads

## Who is Databricks?

-   Founded by the creators of Apache Spark, Delta Lake and MLflow

## Optimized environment

-   Azure Databricks is focused on performance and cost-efficiency in the cloud.
-   Apache Spark workloads that can increase performance and reduce costs by as much as 10-100x when running on Azure
    -   High-speed connectors to Azure storage services.
        -   Azure Blob Store
        -   Azure Data Lake
    -   Auto-scaling and auto-termination of Spark clusters to minimize costs
    -   Caching
    -   Indexing
    -   Advanced query optimization
-   Users spend more time building applications, and less time focused on managing clusters and infrastructure

### Spark utilities

-   At its core is the Spark `Engine`
-   `DataFrames` API:
    -   Abstraction above Resilient Distributed Datasets `RDD`
    -   Improve performance 5-20x over traditional RDDs
